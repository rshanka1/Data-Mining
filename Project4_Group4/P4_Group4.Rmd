#### Holdover from last assignment

#### Question 8

#### Classification of Music Popularity

For this problem, you will work to classify a song's popularity. Specifically, you will develop methods to predict whether a song will make the Top10 of Billboard's Hot 100 Chart. The data set consists of song from the Top10 of Billboard's Hot 100 Chart from 1990-2010 along with a sampling of other songs that did not make the list1.

The variables included in the data set include several description of the song and artist (including song title and id numbers), the year the song was released. Additionally, several variables describe the song attributes: time signature, loudness, tempo, key, energy pitch, and timbre (measured of different sections of the song). The last variable is binary indicated whether the song was in the Top10 or not.

You will use the variables of the song attributes (excluding the variables involving confidence in that attribute, e.g., key confidence) to predict whether the song will be popular or not.


#### Question 8a

Load in the music data. You should not use the artist or song title and IDs in the prediction along with the confidence variables.


```{r question8a}
# Loading the music data
music_real <- read.csv("data/music.csv")

# Removing IDs, artist, song title variables out of the data 
music <-  music_real[, -c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 9, 11)]

# Checking for NA values in the data
sapply(music, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```


#### Question 8b

Prepare the data for a 10-fold cross-validation. Ensure that each split of the data has a balanced distribution of class labels.


```{r question8b}
# Data preprocessing for 10 fold cross validation

# Setting the seed for reproduciablility
set.seed(294)

# NO of fold
k_fold <- 10

# Creating the folds variable in the data frame
# music$folds <- createFolds(music$Top10, k = n_fold, list = FALSE)
cv_index_list <- createFolds(music$Top10, k = k_fold, list = TRUE, returnTrain = FALSE)

# Checking the class label proportions
for(i in 1:k_fold) {
    fold <- music$Top10[cv_index_list[[i]]]
    fold_length <- length(fold)
    class0_prop <- round(length(fold[fold == 0]) / fold_length, 2)
    class1_prop <- round(length(fold[fold == 1]) /  fold_length, 2)
    print(paste("Fold" , i , "length", fold_length, sep = " "))
    print(paste("Class Label(0)", round(class0_prop, 2), sep = " "))
    print(paste("Class Label(1)", round(class1_prop, 2), sep = " "))
}
```

```


#### Question1g

(12 points) Examine which samples are mis-classified by some of the above models (construct a matrix with a column of predictions for each method: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVMs). Create an ensemble predictor that takes the majority vote of the three models. Calculate and report the accuracy, error, and AUC performance on the testing data.

```{r Question1g}
# Doing the ensemble method
pred_df <- data.frame(Naive_Bayes = nb_pred, Decision_Tree = dtree_pred, SVM = svm_pred)
pred_df_numeric <- data.frame(revalue(nb_pred, c("no" = 0, "yes" = 1)),

#### Question1h

(8 points) Use bagging to fit an ensemble of 100 trees to the training data. Report the error rate on the testing data. Hint: In R, the package adabag includes methods for bagging and boosting of trees, where command bagging could also be used; other packages exist. In Matlab, look for the TreeBagger functions.

```{r Question1h}
# Training the model
bag <- bagging(formula = spam ~., data = train_spam, mfinal = 100)

# Predicting the test set on the trained model
bag_pred <- predict(object = bag, newdata = test_spam[-15])

```


#### Question1i

(8 points) Use boosting to fit an ensemble of 100 trees to the training data. Report the error rate on the testing data. Hint: In R, consider using the adaboost.M1 function (other packages include ada, adaStump, etc.). In Matlab, consider the fitcensemble function.

```{r Question1i}
# Training the model
boost <- boosting(formula = spam ~., data = train_spam, mfinal = 100)

# Predicting the test set on the trained model
boost_pred <- predict(object = boost,newdata = test_spam[-15])

#### Text Classifiction

#### Question3

For this question you will be considering text classification using two different Naive Bayes
models. These approaches will be discussed in class and reference the following book.

Manning, C., Raghavan, P., Schutze, H. Introduction to Information Retrieval, Cambridge University Press, 2008 

<http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/>

In particular, look at Chapter 13 

<http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/text-classification-and-naive-bayes-1.html>

You will be using data from the Presidential State of the Union Addresses available as a zip archive. The speeches are available in text files sorted by year, e.g., a1.txt, ..., a231.txt. The text files are formated such that there is one word per line and most punctuation has been removed (note, there are still hyphens or dashes left in the text files).

#### Question 3a

(4 points) Load the addresses. You will need to create a vector listing the party affliation of each president to match their speech, you may use the file party.txt to help with this classification.

```{r Question3a}
# Loading the addresses
speeches <- DirSource("data/sotu/files/")
speech_corpus <- Corpus(speeches, readerControl = list(language="en", stopwords=FALSE,
                                                       wordLengths=c(0,Inf)))

# Read the party.txt file
party_df <- read.csv("data/sotu/party.txt", header = FALSE, col.names = c("colparty", "colpresident", "colyear"))
```


#### Question 3b

(6 points) Remove stopwords from consideration for the method. The stopwords are available at stopwords.txt.

Predict the party affliations (Democrat / Republican) for the following speeches:

* Donald Trump, 2017
* Barack Obama, 2014
* George W. Bush, 2006
* William Clinton, 1995
* John F. Kennedy, 1962

The training set will be the remaining speeches that can be associated with the Democratic or Republican presidents (note, you will not need all the addresses, but they were included here for completeness of the data). You will need to complete the following steps:

```{r Question3b}
# Loading the stopwords.txt
stopwords <- read.csv("data/sotu/stopwords.txt", header = FALSE, col.names = c("words"))

# Removing Stopword from the considerations
corpus_after_stopwords <- tm_map(speech_corpus, removeWords, stopwords$words)

# Preparing Document Matrix
dtm = DocumentTermMatrix(corpus_after_stopwords, control = list(tolower = TRUE,
                                                                removePunctuation = TRUE, 
                                               removeNumbers = TRUE, stopwords = FALSE, 
                                               wordLengths = c(1,Inf)))
DT <- as.matrix(dtm)
doc_name <- rownames(DT)
file_num <- substring(doc_name, 2, nchar(doc_name) - 4)
DT <- DT[order(as.numeric(file_num)), ]

#Binding the party details to the Corpus matrix
DT <- cbind(DT, colparty = party_df$colparty, colpresident = party_df$colpresident, 
            colyear = party_df$colyear)


# Subset the party dataframe
train_party <- subset(party_df, !(party_df$colyear %in% c(2017, 2014, 2006, 1995, 1962)))
test_party <- subset(party_df, party_df$colyear %in% c(2017, 2014, 2006, 1995, 1962))


```


#### Question 3ci

(10 points) Create a term-document matrix, TD for this set of speeches.


```{r Question3ci}

```


#### Question 3cii

(30 points) For the 5 speeches listed above determine the party affliations of the president. Calculate and report P(C = Dems jX) and P(C = Reb jX) under the Bernoulli model of Naive Bayes. In order to avoid underflow errors, use the log probabilities as discussed in class. Note, for this question and the next you will not use the standard Naive Bayes package, library or function; rather you will implement the method as described in pseudocode of the IR book.


```{r Question3cii}

```


#### Question 3ciii

(30 points) For the 4 speeches listed above determine the party affliations of the president. Calculate and report P(C = Dems jX) and P(C = Reb jX) under the Multinomial model of Naive Bayes.

Hint: A strong suggestion for this question is to first create and test your code on a small document set, e.g., the example in the IR-book. Once you have that working correctly, then run on the SOTU addresses.

```{r Question3ciii}

```


#### Question 3d

(4 points (bonus)) Repeat the prediction of the party affliation for the five speeches listed
using only the other speeches since 1913 as the training data.

```{r Question3d}

```


#### Question 4

(4 points (bonus)) Look at additional analysis and visualization of the State of the Union Addresses (more complex examples will receive the full amount of bonus points). For example, 

* plot the number of unique words and total words in the addresses,
* visualize the frequency of certain words or phrases in the addresses, etc.


```{r Question4}

```
