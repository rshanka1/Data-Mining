of
the
united
states
and
citizens
of
america
tonight
as
we
mark
the
conclusion
of
our
celebration
of
black
history
month
we
are
reminded
of
our
nations
path
toward
civil
rights
and
the
work
that
still
remains
to
be
done
recent
threats
recent
threats
targeting
jewish
community
centers
and
vandalism
of
jewish
cemeteries
as
well
as
last
weeks
shooting
in
kansas
city
remind
us
that
while
we
may
be
a
nation
divided
on
policies
we
are
a
country
that
stands
united
in
condemning
hate
and
evil
in
all
of
its
very
ugly
forms
each
american
generation
passes
the
torch
of
truth
liberty
and
justice
in
an
unbroken
chain
all
the
way
down
to
the
present
that
torch
is
now
in
our
hands
and
we
will
use
it
to
light
up
the
world
i
am
here
tonight
to
deliver
a
message
of
unity
and
strength
and
it
is
a
message
deeply
delivered
from
my
heart
a
new
chapter
of
american
greatness
is
now
beginning
a
new
national
pride
is
sweeping
across
our
nation
and
a
new
surge
of
optimism
is
placing
impossible
dreams
firmly
within
our
grasp
what
we
are
witnessing
today
is
the
renewal
of
the
american
spirit
our
allies
will
find
that
america
is
once
again
ready
to
lead
all
the
nations
of
the
world
friend
or
foe
will
find
that
america
is
strong
america
is
proud
and
america
is
free
in
nine
years
the
united
states
will
celebrate
the
th
anniversary
of
our
founding
years
since
the
day
we
declared
our
independence
it
will
be
one
of
the
great
milestones
in
the
history
of
the
world
but
what
will
america
look
like
as
we
reach
our
th
year
what
kind
of
country
will
we
leave
for
our
children
i
will
not
allow
the
mistakes
of
recent
decades
past
to
define
the
course
of
our
future
for
too
long
weve
watched
our
middle
class
shrink
as
weve
exported
our
jobs
and
wealth
to
foreign
countries
weve
financed
and
built
one
global
project
after
another
but
ignored
the
fates
of
our
children
in
the
inner
cities
of
chicago
baltimore
detroit
and
so
many
other
places
throughout
our
land
weve
defended
the
borders
of
other
nations
while
leaving
our
own
borders
wide
open
for
anyone
to
cross
and
for
drugs
to
pour
in
at
a
now
unprecedented
rate
and
weve
spent
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
overseas
while
our
infrastructure
at
home
has
so
badly
crumbled
then
in
the
earth
shifted
beneath
our
feet
the
rebellion
started
as
a
quiet
protest
spoken
by
families
of
all
colors
and
creeds
families
who
just
wanted
a
fair
shot
for
their
children
and
a
fair
hearing
for
their
concerns
but
then
the
quiet
voices
became
a
loud
chorus
as
thousands
of
citizens
now
spoke
out
together
from
cities
small
and
large
all
across
our
country
finally
the
chorus
became
an
earthquake
and
the
people
turned
out
by
the
tens
of
millions
and
they
were
all
united
by
one
very
simple
but
crucial
demand
that
america
must
put
its
own
citizens
first
because
only
then
can
we
truly
make
america
great
again
dying
industries
will
come
roaring
back
to
life
heroic
veterans
will
get
the
care
they
so
desperately
need
our
military
will
be
given
the
resources
its
brave
warriors
so
richly
deserve
crumbling
infrastructure
will
be
replaced
with
new
roads
bridges
tunnels
airports
and
railways
gleaming
across
our
very
very
beautiful
land
our
terrible
drug
epidemic
will
slow
down
and
ultimately
stop
and
our
neglected
inner
cities
will
see
a
rebirth
of
hope
safety
and
opportunity
above
all
else
we
will
keep
our
promises
to
the
american
people
thank
you
its
been
a
little
over
a
month
since
my
inauguration
and
i
want
to
take
this
moment
to
update
the
nation
on
the
progress
ive
made
in
keeping
those
promises
since
my
election
ford
fiatchrysler
general
motors
sprint
softbank
lockheed
intel
walmart
and
many
others
have
announced
that
they
will
invest
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
in
the
united
states
and
will
create
tens
of
thousands
of
new
american
jobs
the
stock
market
has
gained
almost
trillion
in
value
since
the
election
on
nov
a
record
weve
saved
taxpayers
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
by
bringing
down
the
price
of
fantastic
and
it
is
a
fantastic
new
f
jet
fighter
and
well
be
saving
billions
more
on
contracts
all
across
our
government
we
have
placed
a
hiring
freeze
on
nonmilitary
and
nonessential
federal
workers
we
have
begun
to
drain
the
swamp
of
government
corruption
by
imposing
a
fiveyear
ban
on
lobbying
by
executive
branch
officials
and
a
lifetime
ban
thank
you
thank
you
and
a
lifetime
ban
on
becoming
lobbyists
for
a
foreign
government
we
have
undertaken
a
historic
effort
to
massively
reduce
jobcrushing
regulations
creating
a
deregulation
task
force
inside
of
every
government
agency
and
were
imposing
a
new
rule
which
mandates
that
for
every
one
new
regulation
two
old
regulations
must
be
eliminated
were
going
to
stop
the
regulations
that
threaten
the
future
and
livelihood
of
our
great
coal
miners
we
have
cleared
the
way
for
the
construction
of
the
keystone
and
dakota
access
pipelines
thereby
creating
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
and
ive
issued
a
new
directive
that
new
american
pipelines
be
made
with
american
steel
we
have
withdrawn
the
united
states
from
the
jobkilling
transpacific
partnership
and
with
the
help
of
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
we
have
formed
a
council
with
our
neighbors
in
canada
to
help
ensure
that
women
entrepreneurs
have
access
to
the
networks
markets
and
capital
they
need
to
start
a
business
and
live
out
their
financial
dreams
to
protect
our
citizens
i
have
directed
the
department
of
justice
to
form
a
task
force
on
reducing
violent
crime
i
have
further
ordered
the
departments
of
homeland
security
and
justice
along
with
the
department
of
state
and
the
director
of
national
intelligence
to
coordinate
an
aggressive
strategy
to
dismantle
the
criminal
cartels
that
have
spread
all
across
our
nation
we
will
stop
the
drugs
from
pouring
into
our
country
and
poisoning
our
youth
and
we
will
expand
treatment
for
those
who
have
become
so
badly
addicted
at
the
same
time
my
administration
has
answered
the
pleas
of
the
american
people
for
immigration
enforcement
and
border
security
by
finally
enforcing
our
immigration
laws
we
will
raise
wages
help
the
unemployed
save
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
and
make
our
communities
safer
for
everyone
we
want
all
americans
to
succeed
but
that
cant
happen
in
an
environment
of
lawless
chaos
we
must
restore
integrity
and
the
rule
of
law
at
our
borders
for
that
reason
we
will
soon
begin
the
construction
of
a
great
great
wall
along
our
southern
border
as
we
speak
tonight
we
are
removing
gang
members
drug
dealers
and
criminals
that
threaten
our
communities
and
prey
on
our
very
innocent
citizens
bad
ones
are
going
out
as
i
speak
and
as
i
promised
throughout
the
campaign
to
any
in
congress
who
do
not
believe
we
should
enforce
our
laws
i
would
ask
you
this
one
question
what
would
you
say
to
the
american
family
that
loses
their
jobs
their
income
or
their
loved
one
because
america
refused
to
uphold
its
laws
and
defend
its
borders
our
obligation
is
to
serve
protect
and
defend
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
we
are
also
taking
strong
measures
to
protect
our
nation
from
radical
islamic
terrorism
according
to
data
provided
by
the
department
of
justice
the
vast
majority
of
individuals
convicted
of
terrorism
and
terrorismrelated
offenses
since
came
here
from
outside
of
our
country
we
have
seen
the
attacks
at
home
from
boston
to
san
bernardino
to
the
pentagon
and
yes
even
the
world
trade
center
we
have
seen
the
attacks
in
france
in
belgium
in
germany
and
all
over
the
world
it
is
not
compassionate
but
reckless
to
allow
uncontrolled
entry
from
places
where
proper
vetting
cannot
occur
those
given
the
high
honor
of
admission
to
the
united
states
should
support
this
country
and
love
its
people
and
its
values
we
cannot
allow
a
beachhead
of
terrorism
to
form
inside
america
and
we
cannot
allow
our
nation
to
become
a
sanctuary
for
extremists
that
is
why
my
administration
has
been
working
on
improved
vetting
procedures
and
we
will
shortly
take
new
steps
to
keep
our
nation
safe
and
to
keep
those
out
who
will
do
us
harm
as
promised
i
directed
the
department
of
defense
to
develop
a
plan
to
demolish
and
destroy
isis
a
network
of
lawless
savages
that
have
slaughtered
muslims
and
christians
and
men
women
and
children
of
all
faiths
and
all
beliefs
we
will
work
with
our
allies
including
our
friends
and
allies
in
the
muslim
world
to
extinguish
this
vile
enemy
from
our
planet
i
have
also
imposed
new
sanctions
on
entities
and
individuals
who
support
irans
ballistic
missile
program
and
reaffirmed
our
unbreakable
alliance
with
the
state
of
israel
finally
i
have
kept
my
promise
to
appoint
a
justice
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
from
my
list
of
judges
who
will
defend
our
constitution
i
am
greatly
honored
to
have
maureen
scalia
with
us
in
the
gallery
tonight
thank
you
maureen
her
late
great
husband
antonin
scalia
will
forever
be
a
symbol
of
american
justice
to
fill
his
seat
we
have
chosen
judge
neil
gorsuch
a
man
of
incredible
skill
and
deep
devotion
to
the
law
he
was
confirmed
unanimously
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
am
asking
the
senate
to
swiftly
approve
his
nomination
tonight
as
i
outline
the
next
steps
we
must
take
as
a
country
we
must
honestly
acknowledge
the
circumstances
we
inherited
ninetyfour
million
americans
are
out
of
the
labor
force
over
million
people
are
now
living
in
poverty
and
over
million
americans
are
on
food
stamps
more
than
one
in
five
people
in
their
prime
working
years
are
not
working
we
have
the
worst
financial
recovery
in
years
in
the
last
eight
years
the
past
administration
has
put
on
more
new
debt
than
nearly
all
of
the
other
presidents
combined
weve
lost
more
than
onefourth
of
our
manufacturing
jobs
since
nafta
was
approved
and
weve
lost
factories
since
china
joined
the
world
trade
organization
in
our
trade
deficit
in
goods
with
the
world
last
year
was
nearly
billion
and
overseas
we
have
inherited
a
series
of
tragic
foreign
policy
disasters
solving
these
and
so
many
other
pressing
problems
will
require
us
to
work
past
the
differences
of
party
it
will
require
us
to
tap
into
the
american
spirit
that
has
overcome
every
challenge
throughout
our
long
and
storied
history
but
to
accomplish
our
goals
at
home
and
abroad
we
must
restart
the
engine
of
the
american
economy
making
it
easier
for
companies
to
do
business
in
the
united
states
and
much
much
harder
for
companies
to
leave
our
country
right
now
american
companies
are
taxed
at
one
of
the
highest
rates
anywhere
in
the
world
my
economic
team
is
developing
historic
tax
reform
that
will
reduce
the
tax
rate
on
our
companies
so
they
can
compete
and
thrive
anywhere
and
with
anyone
it
will
be
a
big
big
cut
at
the
same
time
we
will
provide
massive
tax
relief
for
the
middle
class
we
must
create
a
level
playing
field
for
american
companies
and
our
workers
have
to
do
it
currently
when
we
ship
products
out
of
america
many
other
countries
make
us
pay
very
high
tariffs
and
taxes
but
when
foreign
companies
ship
their
products
into
america
we
charge
them
nothing
or
almost
nothing
i
just
met
with
officials
and
workers
from
a
great
american
company
harleydavidson
in
fact
they
proudly
displayed
five
of
their
magnificent
motorcycles
made
in
the
usa
on
the
front
lawn
of
the
white
house
and
they
wanted
me
to
ride
one
and
i
said
no
thank
you
at
our
meeting
i
asked
them
how
are
you
doing
how
is
business
they
said
that
its
good
i
asked
them
further
how
are
you
doing
with
other
countries
mainly
international
sales
they
told
me
without
even
complaining
because
they
have
been
so
mistreated
for
so
long
that
theyve
become
used
to
it
that
its
very
hard
to
do
business
with
other
countries
because
they
tax
our
goods
at
such
a
high
rate
they
said
that
in
the
case
of
another
country
they
taxed
their
motorcycles
at
percent
they
werent
even
asking
for
a
change
but
i
am
i
believe
i
believe
strongly
in
free
trade
but
it
also
has
to
be
fair
trade
its
been
a
long
time
since
we
had
fair
trade
the
first
republican
president
abraham
lincoln
warned
that
the
abandonment
of
the
protective
policy
by
the
american
government
will
produce
want
and
ruin
among
our
people
lincoln
was
right
and
its
time
we
heeded
his
advice
and
his
words
i
am
not
going
to
let
america
and
its
great
companies
and
workers
be
taken
advantage
of
us
any
longer
they
have
taken
advantage
of
our
country
no
longer
i
am
going
to
bring
back
millions
of
jobs
protecting
our
workers
also
means
reforming
our
system
of
legal
immigration
the
current
outdated
system
depresses
wages
for
our
poorest
workers
and
puts
great
pressure
on
taxpayers
nations
around
the
world
like
canada
australia
and
many
others
have
a
meritbased
immigration
system
its
a
basic
principle
that
those
seeking
to
enter
a
country
ought
to
be
able
to
support
themselves
financially
yet
in
america
we
do
not
enforce
this
rule
straining
the
very
public
resources
that
our
poorest
citizens
rely
upon
according
to
the
national
academy
of
sciences
our
current
immigration
system
costs
american
taxpayers
many
billions
of
dollars
a
year
switching
away
from
this
current
system
of
lowerskilled
immigration
and
instead
adopting
a
meritbased
system
we
will
have
so
many
more
benefits
it
will
save
countless
dollars
raise
workers
wages
and
help
struggling
families
including
immigrant
families
enter
the
middle
class
and
they
will
do
it
quickly
and
they
will
be
very
very
happy
indeed
i
believe
that
real
and
positive
immigration
reform
is
possible
as
long
as
we
focus
on
the
following
goals
to
improve
jobs
and
wages
for
americans
to
strengthen
our
nations
security
and
to
restore
respect
for
our
laws
if
we
are
guided
by
the
wellbeing
of
american
citizens
then
i
believe
republicans
and
democrats
can
work
together
to
achieve
an
outcome
that
has
eluded
our
country
for
decades
another
republican
president
dwight
d
eisenhower
initiated
the
last
truly
great
national
infrastructure
program
the
building
of
the
interstate
highway
system
the
time
has
come
for
a
new
program
of
national
rebuilding
america
has
spent
approximately
trillion
in
the
middle
east
all
the
while
our
infrastructure
at
home
is
crumbling
with
the
trillion
we
could
have
rebuilt
our
country
twice
and
maybe
even
three
times
if
we
had
people
who
had
the
ability
to
negotiate
to
launch
our
national
rebuilding
i
will
be
asking
congress
to
approve
legislation
that
produces
a
trillion
investment
in
infrastructure
of
the
united
states
financed
through
both
public
and
private
capital
creating
millions
of
new
jobs
this
effort
will
be
guided
by
two
core
principles
buy
american
and
hire
american
tonight
i
am
also
calling
on
this
congress
to
repeal
and
replace
obamacare
with
reforms
that
expand
choice
increase
access
lower
costs
and
at
the
same
time
provide
better
health
care
mandating
every
american
to
buy
governmentapproved
health
insurance
was
never
the
right
solution
for
our
country
the
way
to
make
health
insurance
available
to
everyone
is
to
lower
the
cost
of
health
insurance
and
that
is
what
we
are
going
to
do
obamacare
premiums
nationwide
have
increased
by
double
and
triple
digits
as
an
example
arizona
went
up
percent
last
year
alone
gov
matt
bevin
of
kentucky
just
said
obamacare
is
failing
in
his
state
the
state
of
kentucky
and
its
unsustainable
and
collapsing
one
third
of
the
counties
have
only
one
insurer
and
theyre
losing
them
fast
they
are
losing
them
so
fast
theyre
leaving
and
many
americans
have
no
choice
at
all
theres
no
choice
left
remember
when
you
were
told
that
you
could
keep
your
doctor
and
keep
your
plan
we
now
know
that
all
of
those
promises
have
been
totally
broken
obamacare
is
collapsing
and
we
must
act
decisively
to
protect
all
americans
action
is
not
a
choice
it
is
a
necessity
so
i
am
calling
on
all
democrats
and
republicans
in
congress
to
work
with
us
to
save
americans
from
this
imploding
obamacare
disaster
here
are
the
principles
that
should
guide
congress
as
we
move
to
create
a
better
health
care
system
for
all
americans
first
we
should
ensure
that
americans
with
preexisting
conditions
have
access
to
coverage
and
that
we
have
a
stable
transition
for
americans
currently
enrolled
in
the
health
care
exchanges
secondly
we
should
help
americans
purchase
their
own
coverage
through
the
use
of
tax
credits
and
expanded
health
savings
accounts
but
it
must
be
the
plan
they
want
not
the
plan
forced
on
them
by
our
government
thirdly
we
should
give
our
state
governors
the
resources
and
flexibility
they
need
with
medicaid
to
make
sure
no
one
is
left
out
fourth
we
should
implement
legal
reforms
that
protect
patients
and
doctors
from
unnecessary
costs
that
drive
up
the
price
of
insurance
and
work
to
bring
down
the
artificially
high
price
of
drugs
and
bring
them
down
immediately
and
finally
the
time
has
come
to
give
americans
the
freedom
to
purchase
health
insurance
across
state
lines
which
will
create
a
truly
competitive
national
marketplace
that
will
bring
costs
way
down
and
provide
far
better
care
so
important
everything
that
is
broken
in
our
country
can
be
fixed
every
problem
can
be
solved
and
every
hurting
family
can
find
healing
and
hope
our
citizens
deserve
this
and
so
much
more
so
why
not
join
forces
and
finally
get
the
job
done
and
get
it
done
right
on
this
and
so
many
other
things
democrats
and
republicans
should
get
together
and
unite
for
the
good
of
our
country
and
for
the
good
of
the
american
people
my
administration
wants
to
work
with
members
of
both
parties
to
make
child
care
accessible
and
affordable
to
help
ensure
new
parents
that
they
have
paid
family
leave
to
invest
in
womens
health
and
to
promote
clean
air
and
clean
water
and
to
rebuild
our
military
and
our
infrastructure
true
love
for
our
people
requires
us
to
find
common
ground
to
advance
the
common
good
and
to
cooperate
on
behalf
of
every
american
child
who
deserves
a
much
brighter
future
an
incredible
young
woman
is
with
us
this
evening
who
should
serve
as
an
inspiration
to
us
all
today
is
rare
disease
day
and
joining
us
in
the
gallery
is
a
rare
disease
survivor
megan
crowley
megan
megan
was
diagnosed
with
pompe
disease
a
rare
and
serious
illness
when
she
was
months
old
she
was
not
expected
to
live
past
on
receiving
this
news
megans
dad
john
fought
with
everything
he
had
to
save
the
life
of
his
precious
child
he
founded
a
company
to
look
for
a
cure
and
helped
develop
the
drug
that
saved
megans
life
today
she
is
years
old
and
a
sophomore
at
notre
dame
megans
story
is
about
the
unbounded
power
of
a
fathers
love
for
a
daughter
but
our
slow
and
burdensome
approval
process
at
the
food
and
drug
administration
keeps
too
many
advances
like
the
one
that
saved
megans
life
from
reaching
those
in
need
if
we
slash
the
restraints
not
just
at
the
fda
but
across
our
government
then
we
will
be
blessed
with
far
more
miracles
just
like
megan
in
fact
our
children
will
grow
up
in
a
nation
of
miracles
but
to
achieve
this
future
we
must
enrich
the
mind
and
the
souls
of
every
american
child
education
is
the
civil
rights
issue
of
our
time
i
am
calling
upon
members
of
both
parties
to
pass
an
education
bill
that
funds
school
choice
for
disadvantaged
youth
including
millions
of
africanamerican
and
latino
children
these
families
should
be
free
to
choose
the
public
private
charter
magnet
religious
or
home
school
that
is
right
for
them
joining
us
tonight
in
the
gallery
is
a
remarkable
woman
denisha
merriweather
as
a
young
girl
denisha
struggled
in
school
and
failed
third
grade
twice
but
then
she
was
able
to
enroll
in
a
private
center
for
learning
great
learning
center
with
the
help
of
a
tax
credit
and
a
scholarship
program
today
she
is
the
first
in
her
family
to
graduate
not
just
from
high
school
but
from
college
later
this
year
she
will
get
her
masters
degree
in
social
work
we
want
all
children
to
be
able
to
break
the
cycle
of
poverty
just
like
denisha
but
to
break
the
cycle
of
poverty
we
must
also
break
the
cycle
of
violence
the
murder
rate
in
experienced
its
largest
singleyear
increase
in
nearly
half
a
century
in
chicago
more
than
people
were
shot
last
year
alone
and
the
murder
rate
so
far
this
year
has
been
even
higher
this
is
not
acceptable
in
our
society
every
american
child
should
be
able
to
grow
up
in
a
safe
community
to
attend
a
great
school
and
to
have
access
to
a
highpaying
job
but
to
create
this
future
we
must
work
with
not
against
not
against
the
men
and
women
of
law
enforcement
we
must
build
bridges
of
cooperation
and
trust
not
drive
the
wedge
of
disunity
and
its
really
its
what
it
is
division
its
pure
unadulterated
division
we
have
to
unify
police
and
sheriffs
are
members
of
our
community
theyre
friends
and
neighbors
theyre
mothers
and
fathers
sons
and
daughters
and
they
leave
behind
loved
ones
every
day
who
worry
about
whether
or
not
theyll
come
home
safe
and
sound
we
must
support
the
incredible
men
and
women
of
law
enforcement
and
we
must
support
the
victims
of
crime
i
have
ordered
the
department
of
homeland
security
to
create
an
office
to
serve
american
victims
the
office
is
called
voice
victims
of
immigration
crime
engagement

providing
a

i
just

to
our
great
general
jim
mattis

reconfirmed
that
and
i
quote
ryan

a
part
of
a
highly
successful
raid
that
generated
large
amounts
of
vital
intelligence
that
will
lead
to
many
more
victories
in
the
future
against
our
enemy
ryans
legacy
is
etched
into
eternity
thank
you
and
ryan
is
looking
down
right
now
you
know
that
and
hes
very
happy
because
i
think
he
just
broke
a
record
for
as
the
bible
teaches
us
there
is
no
greater
act
of
love
than
to
lay
down
ones
life
for
ones
friends
ryan
laid
down
his
life
for
his
friends
for
his
country
and
for
our
freedom
and
we
will
never
forget
ryan
to
those
allies
who
wonder
what
kind
of
a
friend
america
will
be
look
no
further
than
the
heroes
who
wear
our
uniform
our
foreign
policy
calls
for
a
direct
robust
and
meaningful
engagement
with
the
world
it
is
american
leadership
based
on
vital
security
interests
that
we
share
with
our
allies
all
across
the
globe
we
strongly
support
nato
an
alliance
forged
through
the
bonds
of
two
world
wars
that
dethroned
fascism
and
a
cold
war
and
defeated
communism
but
our
partners
must
meet
their
financial
obligations
and
now
based
on
our
very
strong
and
frank
discussions
they
are
beginning
to
do
just
that
in
fact
i
can
tell
you
the
money
is
pouring
in
very
nice
we
expect
our
partners
whether
in
nato
in
the
middle
east
or
in
the
pacific
to
take
a
direct
and
meaningful
role
in
both
strategic
and
military
operations
and
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
cost
have
to
do
that
we
will
respect
historic
institutions
but
we
will
respect
the
foreign
rights
of
all
nations
and
they
have
to
respect
our
rights
as
a
nation
also
free
nations
are
the
best
vehicle
for
expressing
the
will
of
the
people
and
america
respects
the
right
of
all
nations
to
chart
their
own
path
my
job
is
not
to
represent
the
world
my
job
is
to
represent
the
united
states
of
america
but
we
know
that
america
is
better
off
when
there
is
less
conflict
not
more
we
must
learn
from
the
mistakes
of
the
past
we
have
seen
the
war
and
the
destruction
that
have
ravaged
and
raged
throughout
the
world
all
across
the
world
the
only
longterm
solution
for
these
humanitarian
disasters
in
many
cases
is
to
create
the
conditions
where
displaced
persons
can
safely
return
home
and
begin
the
long
long
process
of
rebuilding
america
is
willing
to
find
new
friends
and
to
forge
new
partnerships
where
shared
interests
align
we
want
harmony
and
stability
not
war
and
conflict
we
want
peace
wherever
peace
can
be
found
america
is
friends
today
with
former
enemies
some
of
our
closest
allies
decades
ago
fought
on
the
opposite
side
of
these
terrible
terrible
wars
this
history
should
give
us
all
faith
in
the
possibilities
for
a
better
world
hopefully
the
th
year
for
america
will
see
a
world
that
is
more
peaceful
more
just
and
more
free
on
our
th
anniversary
in
citizens
from
across
our
nation
came
to
philadelphia
to
celebrate
americas
centennial
at
that
celebration
the
countrys
builders
and
artists
and
inventors
showed
off
their
wonderful
creations
alexander
graham
bell
displayed
his
telephone
for
the
first
time
remington
unveiled
the
first
typewriter
an
early
attempt
was
made
at
electric
light
thomas
edison
showed
an
automatic
telegraph
and
an
electric
pen
imagine
the
wonders
our
country
could
know
in
americas
th
year
think
of
the
marvels
we
could
achieve
if
we
simply
set
free
the
dreams
of
our
people
cures
to
the
illnesses
that
have
always
plagued
us
are
not
too
much
to
hope
american
footprints
on
distant
worlds
are
not
too
big
a
dream
millions
lifted
from
welfare
to
work
is
not
too
much
to
expect
and
streets
where
mothers
are
safe
from
fear
schools
where
children
learn
in
peace
and
jobs
where
americans
prosper
and
grow
are
not
too
much
to
ask
when
we
have
all
of
this
we
will
have
made
america
greater
than
ever
before
for
all
americans
this
is
our
vision
this
is
our
mission
but
we
can
only
get
there
together
we
are
one
people
with
one
destiny
we
all
bleed
the
same
blood
we
all
salute
the
same
great
american
flag
and
we
are
all
made
by
the
same
god
when
we
fulfill
this
vision
when
we
celebrate
our
years
of
glorious
freedom
we
will
look
back
on
tonight
as
when
this
new
chapter
of
american
greatness
began
the
time
for
small
thinking
is
over
the
time
for
trivial
fights
is
behind
us
we
just
need
the
courage
to
share
the
dreams
that
fill
our
hearts
the
bravery
to
express
the
hopes
that
stir
our
souls
and
the
confidence
to
turn
those
hopes
and
those
dreams
into
action
from
now
on
america
will
be
empowered
by
our
aspirations
not
burdened
by
our
fears
inspired
by
the
future
not
bound
by
failures
of
the
past
and
guided
by
a
vision
not
blinded
by
our
doubts
i
am
asking
all
citizens
to
embrace
this
renewal
of
the
american
spirit
i
am
asking
all
members
of
congress
to
join
me
in
dreaming
big
and
bold
and
daring
things
for
our
country
i
am
asking
everyone
watching
tonight
to
seize
this
moment
believe
in
yourselves
believe
in
your
future
and
believe
once
more
in
america
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
