to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
state
of
the
union
is
sound
our
economy
is
recovering
from
a
recession
a
national
energy
plan
is
in
place
and
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
is
decreasing
we
have
been
at
peace
for
four
uninterrupted
years
but
our
nation
has
serious
problems
inflation
and
unemployment
are
unacceptably
high
the
world
oil
market
is
increasingly
tight
there
are
trouble
spots
throughout
the
world
and
american
hostages
are
being
held
in
iran
against
international
law
and
against
every
precept
of
human
affairs
however
i
firmly
believe
that
as
a
result
of
the
progress
made
in
so
many
domestic
and
international
areas
over
the
past
four
years
our
nation
is
stronger
wealthier
more
compassionate
and
freer
than
it
was
four
years
ago
i
am
proud
of
that
fact
and
i
believe
the
congress
should
be
proud
as
well
for
so
much
of
what
has
been
accomplished
over
the
past
four
years
has
been
due
to
the
hard
work
insights
and
cooperation
of
congress
i
applaud
the
congress
for
its
efforts
and
its
achievements
in
this
state
of
the
union
message
i
want
to
recount
the
achievements
and
progress
of
the
last
four
years
and
to
offer
recommendations
to
the
congress
for
this
year
while
my
term
as
president
will
end
before
the
th
congress
begins
its
work
in
earnest
i
hope
that
my
recommendations
will
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
direction
this
country
should
take
so
we
build
on
the
record
of
the
past
four
years
record
of
progress
when
i
took
office
our
nation
faced
a
number
of
serious
domestic
and
international
problems
no
national
energy
policy
existed
and
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
was
rapidly
increasing
public
trust
in
the
integrity
and
openness
of
the
government
was
low
the
federal
government
was
operating
inefficiently
in
administering
essential
programs
and
policies
major
social
problems
were
being
ignored
or
poorly
addressed
by
the
federal
government
our
defense
posture
was
declining
as
a
result
of
a
defense
budget
which
was
continuously
shrinking
in
real
terms
the
strength
of
the
nato
alliance
needed
to
be
bolstered
tensions
between
israel
and
egypt
threatened
another
middle
east
war
and
americas
resolve
to
oppose
human
rights
violations
was
under
serious
question
over
the
past
months
clear
progress
has
been
made
in
solving
the
challenges
we
found
in
january
of
almost
all
of
our
comprehensive
energy
program
have
been
enacted
and
the

has
been
established
to
administer
the
program
confidence
in
the

integrity
has
been
restored
and
respect
for
the
governments
openness
and
fairness
has
been
renewed
the
government
has
been
made
more
effective
and
efficient
the
civil

system
was
completely
reformed
for
the
first
time
this
century
reorganization
initiatives
have
been
proposed
to
the

two
new

been
placed
in
each

has
been
reformed
through
creation
of

have
been
established
to
assure

are
being
deregulated
critical
social
problems
many
long
ignored
by
the
federal
government
have
been
addressed
directly
an
urban
policy
was
developed
and
implemented
to
reverse
the
decline
in
our
urban
areas
the
social
security
system
was
refinanced
to
put
it
on
a
sound
financial
basis
the
humphreyhawkins
full

act
was
enacted
federal
assistance
for

was
expanded
by
more
than
percent
the
minimum

was
increased
to
levels
needed
to
ease
the
effects
of
inflation
affirmative
action
has
been
pursued
aggressively
more
blacks
hispanics
and
women
have
been
appointed
to
senior
government
positions
and
to
judgeships
than
at
any
other
time
in
our
history
the
era
ratification
deadline
was
extended
to

the

more

doubled
the

first
sectoral
policies
were
put
in
place
for

with
my
administration
demonstrating
the
value
of
cooperation
between
the
government
business
and
labor
reversing
previous
trends
real
defense
spending
has
increased
every
year
since
the
real
increase
in
fy
defense
spending
is
well
above
percent
and
i
expect
fy
defense
spending
to
be
even
higher
looking
ahead
the
defense
program
i
am
proposing
is
premised
on
a
real
increase
in
defense
spending
over
the
next
five
years
of
percent
or
more
the
nato
alliance
has
proven
its
unity
in
responding
to
the
situations
in
eastern
europe
and
southwest

and
in
agreeing
on
the
issues
to
be

the

in

established
at

and
by

between

and

is
being
buttressed
on
two
fronts
steady
progress
in
the
normalization
of
egyptianisraeli
relations
in
many
fields
and
the
commitment
of
both
egypt
and
israel
with

assistance
to
see
through
to
successful
conclusion
the
autonomy
negotiations
for
the
west

and
gaza
the
panama
canal
treaties
have
been
put
into
effect
which
has
helped
to
improve
relations
with
latin
america
we
have
continued
this
nations
strong
commitment
to
the
pursuit
of
human
rights
throughout
the
world
evenhandedly
and
objectively
our
commitment
to
a
worldwide
human
rights
policy
has
remained
firm
and
many
other
countries
have
given
high
priority
to
it
our
resolve
to
oppose
aggression
such
as
the
illegal
invasion
of
the
soviet
union
into
afghanistan
has
been
supported
by
tough
action
i
ensuring
economic
strength
economy
during
the
last
decade
our
nation
has
withstood
a
series
of
economic
shocks
unprecedented
in
peacetime
the
most
dramatic
of
these
has
been
the
explosive
increases
of
opec
oil
prices
but
we
have
also
faced
world
commodity
shortages
natural
disasters
agricultural
shortages
and
major
challenges
to
world
peace
and
security
our
ability
to
deal
with
these
shocks
has
been
impaired
because
of
a
decrease
in
the
growth
of
productivity
and
the
persistence
of
underlying
inflationary
forces
built
up
over
the
past
years
nevertheless
the
economy
has
proved
to
be
remarkably
resilient
real
output
has
grown
at
an
average
rate
of
percent
per
year
since
i
took
office
and
employment
has
grown
by
percent
we
have
added
about
million
productive
private
sector
jobs
to
the
economy
however
unacceptably
high
inflationthe
most
difficult
economic
problem
i
have
facedpersists
this
inflationwhich
threatens
the
growth
productivity
and
stability
of
our
economyrequires
that
we
restrain
the
growth
of
the
budget
to
the
maximum
extent
consistent
with
national
security
and
human
compassion
i
have
done
so
in
my
earlier
budgets
and
in
my
fy
budget
however
while
restraint
is
essential
to
any
appropriate
economic
policy
high
inflation
cannot
be
attributed
solely
to
government
spending
the
growth
in
budget
outlays
has
been
more
the
result
of
economic
factors
than
the
cause
of
them
we
are
now
in
the
early
stages
of
economic
recovery
following
a
short
recession
typically
a
postrecessionary
period
has
been
marked
by
vigorous
economic
growth
aided
by
antirecessionary
policy
measures
such
as
large
tax
cuts
or
big
stimulation
spending
programs
i
have
declined
to
recommend
such
actions
to
stimulate
economic
activity
because
the
persistent
inflationary
pressures
that
beset
our
economy
today
dictate
a
restrained
fiscal
policy
accordingly
i
am
asking
the
congress
to
postpone
until
january
the
personal
tax
reductions
i
had
earlier
proposed
to
take
effect
on
january
of
this
year
however
my
budget
proposes
significant
tax
changes
to
increase
the
sources
of
financing
for
business
investment
while
emphasizing
the
need
for
continued
fiscal
restraint
this
budget
takes
the
first
major
step
in
a
longterm
tax
reduction
program
designed
to
increase
capital
formation
the
failure
of
our
nation
s
capital
stock
to
grow
at
a
rate
that
keeps
pace
with
its
labor
force
has
clearly
been
one
cause
of
our
productivity
slowdown
higher
investment
rates
are
also
critically
needed
to
meet
our
nations
energy
needs
and
to
replace
energyinefficient
plants
and
equipment
with
new
energysaving
physical
plants
the
level
of
investment
that
is
called
for
will
not
occur
in
the
absence
of
policies
to
encourage
it
therefore
my
budget
proposes
a
major
liberalization
of
tax
allowances
for
depreciation
as
well
as
simplified
depreciation
accounting
increasing
the
allowable
rates
by
about
percent
i
am
also
proposing
improvements
in
the
investment
tax
credit
making
it
refundable
to
meet
the
investment
needs
of
firms
with
no
current
earnings
these
two
proposals
along
with
carefullyphased
tax
reductions
for
individuals
will
improve
both
economic
efficiency
and
tax
equity
i
urge
the
congress
to
enact
legislation
along
the
lines
and
timetable
i
have
proposed
the
budget
the
fy
budget
i
have
sent
to
the
congress
continues
our
fouryear
policy
of
prudence
and
restraint
while
the
budget
deficits
during
my
term
are
higher
than
i
would
have
liked
their
size
is
determined
for
the
most
part
by
economic
conditions
and
in
spite
of
these
conditions
the
relative
size
of
the
deficit
continues
to
decline
in
before
i
took
office
the
budget
deficit
equalled
percent
of
gross
national
product
it
had
been
cut
to
percent
in
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
my
budget
contains
a
deficit
estimated
to
be
less
than
percent
of
our
gross
national
product
the
rate
of
growth
in
federal
spending
has
been
held
to
a
minimum
nevertheless
outlays
are
still
rising
more
rapidly
than
many
had
anticipated
the
result
of
many
powerful
forces
in
our
society
we
face
a
threat
to
our
security
as
events
in
afghanistan
the
middle
east
and
eastern
europe
make
clear
we
have
a
steadily
aging
population
and
as
a
result
the
biggest
single
increase
in
the
federal
budget
is
the
rising
cost
of
retirement
programs
particularly
social
security
we
face
other
important
domestic
needs
to
continue
responsibility
for
the
disadvantaged
to
provide
the
capital
needed
by
our
cities
and
our
transportation
systems
to
protect
our
environment
to
revitalize
american
industry
and
to
increase
the
export
of
american
goods
and
services
so
essential
to
the
creation
of
jobs
and
a
trade
surplus
yet
the
federal
government
itself
may
not
always
be
the
proper
source
of
such
assistance
for
example
it
must
not
usurp
functions
if
they
can
be
more
appropriately
decided
upon
managed
and
financed
by
the
private
sector
or
by
state
and
local
governments
my
administration
has
always
sought
to
consider
the
proper
focus
of
responsibility
for
the
most
efficient
resolution
of
problems
we
have
also
recognized
the
need
to
simplify
the
system
of
grants
to
state
and
local
governments
i
have
again
proposed
several
grant
consolidations
in
the
budget
including
a
new
proposal
that
would
consolidate
several
highway
programs
the
pressures
for
growth
in
federal
use
of
national
resources
are
great
my
administration
has
initiated
many
new
approaches
to
cope
with
these
pressures
we
started
a
multiyear
budget
system
and
we
began
a
system
for
controlling
federal
credit
programs
yet
in
spite
of
increasing
needs
to
limit
spending
growth
we
have
consistently
adhered
to
these
strong
budget
principles
our
nations
armed
forces
must
always
stand
sufficiently
strong
to
deter
aggression
and
to
assure
our
security
an
effective
national
energy
plan
is
essential
to
increase
domestic
production
of
oil
and
gas
to
encourage
conservation
of
our
scarce
energy
resources
to
stimulate
conversion
to
more
abundant
fuels
and
to
reduce
our
trade
deficit
the
essential
human
needs
for
our
citizens
must
be
given
the
highest
priority
the
federal
government
must
lead
the
way
in
investment
in
the
nations
technological
future
the
federal
government
has
an
obligation
to
nurture
and
protect
our
environmentthe
common
resource
birthright
and
sustenance
of
the
american
people
my
budget
continues
to
support
these
principles
it
also
proposes
responsible
tax
reductions
to
encourage
a
more
productive
economy
and
adequate
funding
of
our
highest
priority
programs
within
an
overall
policy
of
constraint
fiscal
restraint
must
be
continued
in
the
years
ahead
budgets
must
be
tight
enough
to
convince
those
who
set
wages
and
prices
that
the
federal
government
is
serious
about
fighting
inflation
but
not
so
tight
as
to
choke
off
all
growth
careful
budget
policy
should
be
supplemented
by
other
measures
designed
to
reduce
inflation
at
lower
cost
in
lost
output
and
employment
these
other
steps
include
measures
to
increase
investmentsuch
as
the
tax
proposals
included
in
my
budgetand
measures
to
increase
competition
and
productivity
in
our
economy
voluntary
incomes
policies
can
also
directly
influence
wages
and
prices
in
the
direction
of
moderation
and
thereby
bring
inflation
down
faster
and
at
lower
cost
to
the
economy
through
a
taxbased
incomes
policy
tip
we
could
provide
tax
incentives
for
firms
and
workers
to
moderate
their
wage
and
price
increases
in
the
coming
years
control
of
federal
expenditures
can
make
possible
periodic
tax
reductions
the
congress
should
therefore
begin
now
to
evaluate
the
potentialities
of
a
tip
program
so
that
when
the
next
round
of
tax
reductions
is
appropriate
a
tip
program
will
be
seriously
considered
employment
during
the
last
four
years
we
have
given
top
priority
to
meeting
the
needs
of
workers
and
providing
additional
job
opportunities
to
those
who
seek
work
since
the
end
of
almost

new
jobs
have
been
added
to
the
nations
economy

employment
has
reached
million
more
jobs
than
ever
before

held
by
women

young

four

increased

for

more

trade
over
the
past
year
the
us
trade
picture
improved
as
a
result
of
solid
export
gains
in
both
manufactured
and
agricultural
products
agricultural
exports
reached
a
new
record
of
over
billion
while
manufactured
exports
have
grown
by
percent
to
a
record
billion
in
these
areas
the
united
states
recorded
significant
surpluses
of
billion
and
billion
respectively
while
our
oil
imports
remained
a
major
drain
on
our
foreign
exchange
earnings
that
drain
was
somewhat
moderated
by
a
percent
decline
in
the
volume
of
oil
imports
us
trade
negotiators
made
significant
progress
over
the
past
year
in
assuring
effective
implementation
of
the
agreements
negotiated
during
the
tokyo
round
of
multilateral
trade
negotiations
agreements
reached
with
the
japanese
government
for
example
will
assure
that
the
united
states
will
be
able
to
expand
its
exports
to
the
japanese
market
in
such
key
areas
as
telecommunications
equipment
tobacco
and
lumber
efforts
by
us
trade
negotiators
also
helped
to
persuade
a
number
of
key
developing
countries
to
accept
many
of
the
nontariff
codes
negotiated
during
the
multilateral
trade
negotiations
this
will
assure
that
these
countries
will
increasingly
assume
obligations
under
the
international
trading
system
a
difficult
world
economic
environment
posed
a
challenge
for
the
management
of
trade
relations
us
trade
negotiators
were
called
upon
to
manage
serious
sectoral
problems
in
such
areas
as
steel
and
helped
to
assure
that
us
chemical
exports
will
have
continued
access
to
the
european
market
close
consultations
with
the
private
sector
in
the
united
states
have
enabled
us
trade
negotiators
to
pinpoint
obstacles
to
us
trade
in
services
and
to
build
a
basis
for
future
negotiations
services
have
been
an
increasingly
important
source
of
export
earnings
for
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
must
assure
continued
and
increased
access
to
foreign
markets
the
trade
position
of
the
united
states
has
improved
but
vigorous
efforts
are
needed
in
a
number
of
areas
to
assure
continued
market
access
for
us
exports
particularly
agricultural
and
high
technology
products
in
which
the
united
states
continues
to
have
a
strong
competitive
edge
continued
efforts
are
also
needed
to
remove
many
domestic
disincentives
which
now
hamper
us
export
growth
and
we
must
ensure
that
countries
do
not
manipulate
investment
or
impose
investment
performance
requirements
which
distort
trade
and
cost
us
jobs
in
this
country
in
short
we
must
continue
to
seek
freebut
fairtrade
that
is
the
policy
my
administration
has
pursued
from
the
beginning
even
in
areas
where
foreign
competition
has
clearly
affected
our
domestic
industry
in
the
steel
industry
for
instance
we
have
put
trigger
price
mechanism
into
place
to
help
prevent
the
dumping
of
steel
that
action
has
strengthened
the
domestic
steel
industry
in
the
automobile
industry
we
have
worked
without
resort
to
import
quotasto
strengthen
the
industrys
ability
to
modernize
and
compete
effectively
small
business
i
have
often
said
that
there
is
nothing
small
about
small
business
in
america
these
firms
account
for
nearly
onehalf
our
gross
national
product
over
half
of
new
technology
and
much
more
than
half
of
the
jobs
created
by
industry
because
this
sector
of
the
economy
is
the
very
lifeblood
of
our
national
economy
we
have
done
much
together
to
improve
the
competitive
climate
for
smaller
firms
these
concerted
efforts
have
been
an
integral
part
of
my
program
to
revitalize
the
economy
they
include
my
campaign
to
shrink
substantially
the
cash
and
time
consuming
red
tape
burden
imposed
on
business
they
include
my
personallydirected
policy
of
ambitiously
increasing
the
federal
contracting
dollars
going
to
small
firms
especially
those
owned
by
women
and
minorities
and
they
include
my
proposals
to
reinvigorate
existing
small
businesses
and
assist
the
creation
of
new
ones
through
tax
reform
financing
assistance
market
expansion
and
support
of
product
innovation
many
of
my
initiatives
to
facilitate
the
creation
and
growth
of
small
businesses
were
made
in
response
to
the
white
house
conference
on
small
business
which
i
convened
my
administration
began
the
implementation
of
most
of
the
ideas
produced
last
year
by
that
citizens
advisory
body
others
need
to
be
addressed
i
have
proposed
the
reconvening
of
the
conference
next
year
to
review
progress
reassess
priorities
and
set
new
goals
in
the
interim
i
hope
that
the
incoming
administration
and
the
new
congress
will
work
with
the
committee
i
have
established
to
keep
these
business
development
ideas
alive
and
help
implement
conference
recommendations
minority
business
one
of
the
most
successful
developments
of
my
administration
has
been
the
growth
and
strengthening
of
minority
business
this
is
the
first
administration
to
put
the
issue
on
the
policy
agenda
as
a
matter
of
major
importance
to
implement
the
results
of
our
early
efforts
in
this
field
i
submitted
legislation
to
congress
designed
to
further
the
development
of
minority
business
we
have
reorganized
the
office
of
minority
business
into
the
minority
business
development
administration
in
the
department
of
commerce
mbda
has
already
proven
to
be
a
major
factor
in
assisting
minority
businesses
to
achieve
equitable
competitive
positions
in
the
marketplace
the
federal
governments
procurement
from
minorityowned
firms
has
nearly
tripled
since
i
took
office
federal
deposits
in
minorityowned
banks
have
more
than
doubled
and
minority
ownership
of
radio
and
television
stations
has
nearly
doubled
the
sba
administered
a
pilot
program
for
procurement
with
the
army
proved
to
be
successful
and
i
recently
expanded
the
number
of
agencies
involved
to
include
nasa
and
the
departments
of
energy
and
transportation
i
firmly
believe
the
critical
path
to
full
freedom
and
equality
for
americas
minorities
rests
with
the
ability
of
minority
communities
to
participate
competitively
in
the
free
enterprise
system
i
believe
the
government
has
a
fundamental
responsibility
to
assist
in
the
development
of
minority
business
and
i
hope
the
progress
made
in
the
last
four
years
will
continue
ii
creating
energy
security
since
i
took
office
my
highest
legislative
priorities
have
involved
the
reorientation
and
redirection
of
us
energy
activities
and
for
the
first
time
to
establish
a
coordinated
national
energy
policy
the
struggle
to
achieve
that
policy
has
been
long
and
difficult
but
the
accomplishments
of
the
past
four
years
make
clear
that
our
country
is
finally
serious
about
the
problems
caused
by
our
overdependence
on
foreign
oil
our
progress
should
not
be
lost
we
must
rely
on
and
encourage
multiple
forms
of
energy
productioncoal
crude
oil
natural
gas
solar
nuclear
syntheticsand
energy
conservation
the
framework
put
in
place
over
the
last
four
years
will
enable
us
to
do
this
national
energy
policy
as
a
result
of
actions
my
administration
and
the
congress
have
taken
over
the
past
four
years
our
country
finally
has
a
national
energy
policy
under
my
program
of
phased
decontrol
domestic
crude

will
end
september
as
a
result
exploratory

incentives
have
been
increased
and
coal
production
is
now
at
its
highest
level
in

plan
has
been
approved
by
congress
for
possible
use
in
the
event
of
a
severe
energy
supply
shortage
or

gasohol
production
has
been
dramatically
increased
with
a
program
being
put
in
place
to
produce
million

incentives
have
been
provided
for

imports
by
percentor
million

per
dayover
the
past
four
years
increased
development
of
domestic
energy
sources
although
it
is
essential
that
the
nation
reduce
its
dependence
on
imported
fossil
fuels
and
complete
the
transition
to
reliance
on
domestic
renewable
sources
of
energy
it
is
also
important
that
this
transition
be
accomplished
in
an
orderly
economic
and
environmentally
sound
manner
to
this
end
the
administration
has
launched
several
initiatives
leasing
of
oil
and
natural
gas
on
federal
lands
particularly
the
outer
continental
shelf
has
been
accelerated
at
the
same
time
as
the
administration
has
reformed
leasing
procedures
through
the
amendments
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
the
interior
department
held
six
ocs
lease
sales
the
greatest
number
ever
which
resulted
in
federal
receipts
of
billion
another
record
the
fiveyear
ocs
leasing
schedule
was
completed
requiring
sales
over
the
next
five
years
since
no
general
federal
coal
lease
sales
were
suspended
over
the
past
four
years
the
administration
has
completely
revised
the
federal
coal
leasing
program
to
bring
it
into
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
federal
land
planning
and
management
act
and
other
statutory
provisions
the
program
is
designed
to
balance
the
competing
interests
that
affect
resource
development
on
public
lands
and
to
ensure
that
adequate
supplies
of
coal
will
be
available
to
meet
national
needs
as
a
result
the
first
general
competitive
federal
coal
lease
sale
in
ten
years
will
be
held
this
month
in
july
i
signed
into
law
the
energy
security
act
of
which
established
the
synthetic
fuels
corporation
the
corporation
is
designed
to
spur
the
development
of
commercial
technologies
for
production
of
synthetic
fuels
such
as
liquid
and
gaseous
fuels
from
coal
and
the
production
of
oil
from
oil
shale
the
act
provides
the
corporation
with
an
initial
billion
to
accomplish
these
objectives
the
principal
purpose
of
the
legislation
is
to
ensure
that
the
nation
will
have
available
in
the
late
s
the
option
to
undertake
commercial
development
of
synthetic
fuels
if
that
becomes
necessary
the
energy
security
act
also
provides
significant
incentives
for
the
development
of
gasohol
and
biomass
fuels
thereby
enhancing
the
nations
supply
of
alternative
energy
sources
commitment
to
a
sustainable
energy
future
the
administrations
national
energy
plan
marked
an
historic
departure
from
the
policies
of
previous
administrations
the
plan
stressed
the
importance
of
both
energy
production
and
conservation
to
achieving
our
ultimate
national
goal
of
relying
primarily
on
secure
sources
of
energy
the
national
energy
plan
made
energy
conservation
a
cornerstone
of
our
national
energy
policy
in
i
initiated
the
administrations
solar
domestic
policy
review
this
represented
the
first
step
towards
widespread
introduction
of
renewable
energy
sources
into
the
nations
economy
as
a
result
of
the
review
i
issued
the
solar
message
to
congress
the
first
such
message
in
the
nations
history
the
message
outlined
the
administrations
solar
program
and
established
an
ambitious
national
goal
for
the
year
of
obtaining
percent
of
this
nations
energy
from
solar
and
renewable
sources
the
thrust
of
the
federal
solar
program
is
to
help
industry
develop
solar
energy
sources
by
emphasizing
basic
research
and
development
of
solar
technologies
which
are
not
currently
economic
such
as
photovoltaics
which
generate
energy
directly
from
the
sun
at
the
same
time
through
tax
incentives
education
and
the
solar
energy
and
energy
conservation
bank
the
solar
program
seeks
to
encourage
state
and
local
governments
industry
and
our
citizens
to
expand
their
use
of
solar
and
renewable
resource
technologies
currently
available
as
a
result
of
these
policies
and
programs
the
energy
efficiency
of
the
american
economy
has
improved
markedly
and
investments
in
renewable
energy
sources
have
grown
significantly
it
now
takes
percent
less
energy
to
produce
a
constant
dollar
of
gnp
than
it
did
in
january
this
increase
in
efficiency
represents
a
savings
of
over
million
barrels
per
day
of
oil
equivalent
about
the
level
of
total
oil
production
now
occurring
in
alaska
over
the
same
period
federal
support
for
conservation
and
solar
energy
has
increased
by
more
than
percent
to
billion
in
fy
including
the
tax

to
amount
to

commitment
to
nuclear
safety
and
security
since
january
significant
progress
has
been
achieved
in
resolving
three
critical
problems
resulting
from
the
use
of
nuclear
energy
radioactive
waste
management
nuclear
safety
and
weapons
proliferation
in
the
administration
announced
its
nuclear
nonproliferation
policy
and
initiated
the
international
fuel
cycle
evaluation
in
congress
passed
the
nuclear
nonproliferation
act
an
historic
piece
of
legislation
in
february
the
administration
transmitted
its
nuclear
waste
management
policy
to
the
congress
this
policy
was
a
major
advance
over
all
previous
efforts
the
principal
aspects
of
that
policy
are
acknowledging
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
and
the
numerous
technical
and
institutional
issues
adopting
a
technically
and
environmentally
conservative
approach
to
the
first
permanent
repository
and
providing
the
states
with
significant
involvement
in
nuclear
waste
disposal
decisions
by
creating
the
state
planning
council
while
much
of
the
plan
can
be
and
is
being
implemented
administratively
some
new
authorities
are
needed
the
congress
should
give
early
priority
to
enacting
provisions
for
awayfromreactor
storage
and
the
state
planning
council
the
accident
at
three
mile
island
made
the
nation
acutely
aware
of
the
safety
risks
posed
by
nuclear
power
plants
in
response
the
president
established
the
kemeny
commission
to
review
the
accident
and
make
recommendations
virtually
all
of
the
commissions
substantive
recommendations
were
adopted
by
the
administration
and
are
now
being
implemented
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
the
congress
adopted
the
presidents
proposed
plan
for
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
and
the
nuclear
safety
oversight
committee
was
established
to
ensure
that
the
administrations
decisions
were
implemented
nuclear
safety
will
remain
a
vital
concern
in
the
years
ahead
we
must
continue
to
press
ahead
for
the
safe
secure
disposal
of
radioactive
wastes
and
prevention
of
nuclear
proliferation
while
significant
growth
in
foreign
demand
for
us
steam
coal
is
foreseen
congestion
must
be
removed
at
major
us
coal
exporting
ports
such
as
hampton
roads
virginia
and
baltimore
maryland
my
administration
has
worked
through
the
interagency
coal
task
force
study
to
promote
cooperation
and
coordination
of
resources
between
shippers
railroads
vessel
broker
operators
and
port
operators
and
to
determine
the
most
appropriate
federal
role
in
expanding
and
modernizing
coal
export
facilities
including
dredging
deeper
channels
at
selected
ports
as
a
result
of
the
task
forces
efforts
administrative
steps
have
been
taken
by
the
corps
of
engineers
to
reduce
significantly
the
amount
of
time
required
for
planning
and
economic
review
of
port
dredging
proposals
the
administration
has
also
recommended
that
the
congress
enact
legislation
to
give
the
president
generic
authority
to
recommend
appropriations
for
channel
dredging
activities
private
industry
will
of
course
play
the
major
role
in
developing
the
united
states
coal
export
facilities
but
the
government
must
continue
to
work
to
facilitate
transportation
to
foreign
markets
iii
enhancing
basic
human
and
social
needs
for
too
long
prior
to
my
administration
many
of
our
nations
basic
human
and
social
needs
were
being
ignored
or
handled
insensitively
by
the
federal
government
over
the
last
four
years
we
have
significantly
increased
funding
for
many
of
the
vital
programs
in
these
areas
developed
new
programs
where
needs
were
unaddressed
targeted
federal
support
to
those
individuals
and
areas
most
in
need
of
our
assistance
and
removed
barriers
that
have
unnecessarily
kept
many
disadvantaged
citizens
from
obtaining
aid
for
their
most
basic
needs
our
record
has
produced
clear
progress
in
the
effort
to
solve
some
of
the
countrys
fundamental
human
and
social
problems
my
administration
and
the
congress
working
together
have
demonstrated
that
government
must
and
can
meet
our
citizens
basic
human
and
social
needs
in
a
responsible
and
compassionate
way
but
there
is
an
unfinished
agenda
still
before
the
congress
if
we
are
to
meet
our
obligations
to
help
all
americans
realize
the
dreams
of
sound
health
care
decent
housing
effective
social
services
a
good
education
and
a
meaningful
job
important
legislation
still
must

national
health
plan
during
my
administration
i
proposed
to
congress
a
national
health
plan
which
will
enable
the
country
to
reach
the
goal
of
comprehensive
universal
health
care
coverage
the
legislation
i
submitted
lays
the
foundation
for
this
comprehensive
plan
and
addresses
the
most
serious
problems
of
health
financing
and
delivery
it
is
realistic
and
enactable
it
does
not
overpromise
or
overspend
and
as
a
result
can
be
the
solution
to
the
thirty
years
of
congressional
battles
on
national
health
insurance
my
plan
includes
the
following
key
features
nearly
million
additional
poor
would
receive
fullysubsidized
comprehensive
coverage
prenatal
and
delivery
services
are
provided
for
all
pregnant
women
and
coverage
is
provided
for
all
acute
care
for
infants
in
their
first
year
of
life
the
elderly
and
disabled
would
have
a
limit
of
placed
on
annual
outofpocket
medical
expenses
and
would
no
longer
face
limits
on
hospital
coverage
all
fulltime
employees
and
their
families
would
receive
insurance
against
at
least
major
medical
expenses
under
mandated
employer
coverage
medicare
and
medicaid
would
be
combined
and
expanded
into
an
umbrella
federal
program
healthcare
for
increased
program
efficiency
accountability
and
uniformity
and
strong
cost
controls
and
health
system
reforms
would
be
implemented
including
greater
incentives
for
health
maintenance
organizations
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
compare
my
plan
with
the
alternativesprograms
which
either
do
too
little
to
improve
the
health
care
needs
of
americans
most
in
need
or
programs
which
would
impose
substantial
financial
burdens
on
the
american
taxpayers
i
hope
the
congress
will
see
the
need
for
and
the
benefits
of
my
plan
and
work
toward
prompt
enactment
we
cannot
afford
further
delay
in
this
vital
area
health
care
cost
control
inflation
in
health
care
costs
remains
unacceptably
high
throughout
my
administration
legislation
to
reduce
health
care
cost
inflation
was
one
of
my
highest
priorities
but
was
not
passed
by
the
congress
therefore
my
fy
budget
proposes
sharing
the
responsibility
for
health
care
cost
control
with
the
private
sector
through
voluntary
hospital
cost
guidelines
and
intensified
monitoring
in
the
longer
term
the
health
care
reimbursement
system
must
be
reformed
we
must
move
away
from
inflationary
costbased
reimbursement
and
feeforservice
and
toward
a
system
of
prospective
reimbursement
under
which
health
care
providers
would
operate
within
predetermined
budgets
this
reimbursement
reform
is
essential
to
ultimately
control
inflation
in
health
care
costs
and
will
be
a
significant
challenge
to
the
new
congress
health
promotion
and
disease
prevention
during
my
administration
the
surgeon
general
released
healthy
people
a
landmark
report
on
health
promotion
and
disease
prevention
the
report
signals
the
growing
consensus
that
the
nations
health
strategy
must
be
refocused
in
the
s
to
emphasize
the
prevention
of
disease
specifically
the
report
lays
out
measurable
and
achieveable
goals
in
the
reduction
of
mortality
which
can
be
reached
by
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
endorse
the
principles
of
healthy
people
and
to
adopt
the
recommendations
to
achieve
its
goals
this
will
necessitate
adoption
of
a
broader
concept
of
health
care
to
include
such
areas
as
environmental
health
workplace
health
and
safety
commercial
product
safety
traffic
safety
and
health
education
promotion
and
information
maternal
and
child
health
ensuring
a
healthy
start
in
life
for
children
remains
not
only
a
high
priority
of
my
administration
but
also
one
of
the
most
cost
effective
forms
of
health
care
when
i
took
office
immunization
levels
for
preventable
childhood
diseases
had
fallen
to
as
a
result
of
a
concerted
nationwide
effort
during
my
administration
i
am
pleased
to
report
that
now
at
least
of
children
under
and
virtually
all
schoolage
children
are
immunized
in
addition
reported
cases
of
measles
and
mumps
are
at
their
lowest
levels
ever
under
the
national
health
plan
i
have
proposed
there
would
be
no
costsharing
for
prenatal
and
delivery
services
for
all
pregnant
women
and
for
acute
care
provided
to
infants
in
their
first
year
of
life
these
preventive
services
have
extremely
high
returns
in
terms
of
improved
newborn
and
longterm
child
health
under
the
child
health
assurance
program
chap
legislation
which
i
submitted
to
the
congress
and
which
passed
the
house
an
additional
two
million
lowincome
children
under
would
become
eligible
for
medicaid
benefits
which
would
include
special
health
assessments
chap
would
also
improve
the
continuity
of
care
for
the
nearly
million
children
now
eligible
for
medicaid
an
additional
lowincome
pregnant
women
would
become
eligible
for
prenatal
care
under
the
proposal
i
strongly
urge
the
new
congress
to
enact
chap
and
thereby
provide
millions
of
needy
children
with
essential
health
services
the
legislation
has
had
strong
bipartisan
support
which
should
continue
as
the
details
of
the
bill
are
completed
i
also
urge
the
new
congress
to
provide
strong
support
for
two
highly
successful
ongoing
programs
the
special
supplemental
food
program
for
women
infants
and
children
wic
and
family
planning
the
food
supplements
under
wic
have
been
shown
to
effectively
prevent
ill
health
and
thereby
reduce
later
medical
costs
the
family
planning
program
has
been
effective
at
reducing
unwanted
pregnancies
among
lowincome
women
and
adolescents
expansion
of
services
to
the
poor
and
underserved
during
my
administration
health
services
to
the
poor
and
underserved
have
been
dramatically
increased
the
number
of
national
health
service
corps
nhsc
assignees
providing
services
in
medically
underserved
communities
has
grown
from
in
to
nearly
in
the
population
served
by
the
nhsc
has
more
than
tripled
since
the
number
of
community
health
centers
providing
services
in
high
priority
underserved
areas
has
doubled
during
my
administration
and
will
serve
an
estimated
six
million
people
in
i
strongly
urge
the
new
congress
to
support
these
highly
successful
programs
mental
health
one
of
the
most
significant
health
achievements
during
my
administration
was
the
recent
passage
of
the
mental
health
systems
act
which
grew
out
of
recommendations
of
my
commission
on
mental
health
i
join
many
others
in
my
gratitude
to
the
first
lady
for
her
tireless
and
effective
contribution
to
the
passage
of
this
important
legislation
the
act
is
designed
to
inaugurate
a
new
era
of
federal
and
state
partnership
in
the
planning
and
provision
of
mental
health
services
in
addition
the
act
specifically
provides
for
prevention
and
support
services
to
the
chronically
mentally
ill
to
prevent
unnecessary
institutionalization
and
for
the
development
of
communitybased
mental
health
services
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
provide
adequate
support
for
the
full
and
timely
implementation
of
this
act
health
protection
with
my
active
support
the
congress
recently
passed
medigap
legislation
which
provides
for
voluntary
certification
of
health
insurance
policies
supplemental
to
medicare
to
curb
widespread
abuses
in
this
area
in
the
area
of
toxic
agent
control
legislation
which
i
submitted
to
the
congress
recently
passed
this
will
provide
for
a
superfund
to
cover
hazardous
waste
cleanup
costs
in
the
area
of
accidental
injury
control
we
have
established
automobile
safety
standards
and
increased
enforcement
activities
with
respect
to
the
mph
speed
limit
by
the
end
of
the
decade
these
actions
are
expected
to
save
over
lives
and
serious
injuries
each
year
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
continue
strong
support
for
all
these
activities
food
and
nutrition
building
on
the
comprehensive
reform
of
the
food
stamp
program
that
i
proposed
and
congress
passed
in
my
administration
and
the
congress
worked
together
in
and
to
enact
several
other
important
changes
in
the
program
these
changes
will
further
simplify
administration
and
reduce
fraud
and
error
will
make
the
program
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
elderly
and
disabled
and
will
increase
the
cap
on
allowable
program
expenditures
the
food
stamp
act
will
expire
at
the
end
of
fiscal
it
is
essential
that
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
continue
this
program
to
ensure
complete
eradication
of
the
debilitating
malnutrition
witnessed
and
documented
among
thousands
of
children
in
the
s
drug
abuse
prevention
at
the
beginning
of
my
administration
there
were
over
a
half
million
heroin
addicts
in
the
united
states
our
continued
emphasis
on
reducing
the
supply
of
heroin
as
well
as
providing
treatment
and
rehabilitation
to
its
victims
has
reduced
the
heroin
addict
population
reduced
the
number
of
heroin
overdose
deaths
by
and
reduced
the
number
of
heroin
related
injuries
by
we
have
also
seen
and
encouraged
a
national
movement
of
parents
and
citizens
committed
to
reversing
the
very
serious
and
disturbing
trends
of
adolescent
drug
abuse
drug
abuse
in
many
forms
will
continue
to
detract
however
from
the
quality
of
life
of
many
americans
to
prevent
that
i
see
four
great
challenges
in
the
years
ahead
first
we
must
deal
aggressively
with
the
supplies
of
illegal
drugs
at
their
source
through
joint
crop
destruction
programs
with
foreign
nations
and
increased
law
enforcement
and
border
interdiction
second
we
must
look
to
citizens
and
parents
across
the
country
to
help
educate
the
increasing
numbers
of
american
youth
who
are
experimenting
with
drugs
to
the
dangers
of
drug
abuse
education
is
a
key
factor
in
reducing
drug
abuse
third
we
must
focus
our
efforts
on
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
in
the
workplace
for
not
only
does
this
abuse
contribute
to
low
productivity
but
it
also
destroys
the
satisfaction
and
sense
of
purpose
all
americans
can
gain
from
the
work
experience
fourth
we
need
a
change
in
attitude
from
an
attitude
which
condones
the
casual
use
of
drugs
to
one
that
recognizes
the
appropriate
use
of
drugs
for
medical
purposes
and
condemns
the
inappropriate
and
harmful
abuse
of
drugs
i
hope
the
congress
and
the
new
administration
will
take
action
to
meet
each
of
these
challenges
education
the
american
people
have
always
recognized
that
education
is
one
of
the
soundest
investments
they
can
make
the
dividends
are
reflected
in
every
dimension
of
our
national
lifefrom
the
strength
of
our
economy
and
national
security
to
the
vitality
of
our
music
art
and
literature
among
the
accomplishments
that
have
given
me
the
most
satisfaction
over
the
last
four
years
are
the
contributions
that
my
administration
has
been
able
to
make
to
the
wellbeing
of
students
and
educators
throughout
the
country
this
administration
has
collaborated
successfully
with
the
congress
on
landmark
education
legislation
working
with
the
congressional
leadership
my
administration
spotlighted
the
importance
of
education
by
creating
a
new
department
of
education
the
department
has
given
education
a
stronger
voice
at
the
federal
level
while
at
the
same
time
reserving
the
actual
control
and
operation
of
education
to
states
localities
and
private
institutions
the
department
has
successfully
combined
nearly
federal
education
programs
into
a
cohesive
streamlined
organization
that
is
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
educators
and
students
the
department
has
made
strides
to
cut
red
tape
and
paperwork
and
thereby
to
make
the
flow
of
federal
dollars
to
school
districts
and
institutions
of
higher
education
more
efficient
it
is
crucial
that
the
department
be
kept
intact
and
strengthened
our
collaboration
with
the
congress
has
resulted
in
numerous
other
important
legislative
accomplishments
for
education
a
little
over
two
years
ago
i
signed
into
law
on
the
same
day
two
major
billsone
benefiting
elementary
and
secondary
education
and
the
other
postsecondary
education
the
education
amendments
of
embodied
nearly
all
of
my
administrations
proposals
for
improvements
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
including
important
new
programs
to
improve
students
achievement
in
the
basic
skills
and
to
aid
school
districts
with
exceptionally
high
concentrations
of
children
from
lowincome
families
the
middle
income
student
assistance
act
legislation
jointly
sponsored
by
this
administration
and
the
congressional
leadership
expanded
eligibility
for
needbased
basic
educational
opportunity
grants
to
approximately
onethird
of
the
students
enrolled
in
postsecondary
education
and
made
many
more
students
eligible
for
the
first
time
for
other
types
of
grants
workstudy
and
loans
just
three
and
a
half
months
ago
my
administration
and
the
congress
successfully
concluded
over
two
years
of
work
on
a
major
reauthorization
bill
that
further
expands
benefits
to
postsecondary
education
reflected
in
the
education
amendments
of
are
major
administration
recommendations
for
improvements
in
the
higher
education
actincluding
proposals
for
better
loan
access
for
students
a
new
parent
loan
program
simplified
application
procedures
for
student
financial
aid
a
strengthened
federal
commitment
to
developing
colleges
particularly
the
historically
black
institutions
a
new
authorization
for
equipment
and
facilities
modernization
funding
for
the
nations
major
research
universities
and
revitalized
international
education
programs
supplementing
these
legislative
accomplishments
have
been
important
administrative
actions
aimed
at
reducing
paperwork
and
simplifying
regulations
associated
with
federal
education
programs
we
also
launched
major
initiatives
to
reduce
the
backlog
of
defaulted
student
loans
and
otherwise
to
curb
fraud
abuse
and
waste
in
education
programs
to
insure
that
the
education
enterprise
is
ready
to
meet
the
scientific
and
technological
changes
of
the
future
we
undertook
a
major
study
of
the
status
of
science
and
engineering
education
throughout
the
nation
i
hope
that
the
findings
from
this
report
will
serve
as
a
springboard
for
needed
reforms
at
all
levels
of
education
i
am
proud
that
this
administration
has
been
able
to
provide
the
financial
means
to
realize
many
of
our
legislative
and
administrative
goals
compared
to
the
previous
administrations
last
budget
i
have
requested
the
largest
overall
increase
in
federal
funding
for
education
in
our
nations
history
my
budget
requests
have
been
particularly
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
special
populations
like
minorities
women
the
educationally
and
economically
disadvantaged
the
handicapped
and
students
with
limited
englishspeaking
ability
at
the
same
time
i
have
requested
significant
increases
for
many
programs
designed
to
enhance
the
quality
of
american
education
including
programs
relating
to
important
areas
as
diverse
as
international
education
research
libraries
museums
and
teacher
centers
last
year
i
proposed
to
the
congress
a
major
legislative
initiative
that
would
direct
billion
into
education
and
job
training
programs
designed
to
alleviate
youth
unemployment
through
improved
linkages
between
the
schools
and
the
work
place
this
legislation
generated
bipartisan
support
but
unfortunately
action
on
it
was
not
completed
in
the
final
rushed
days
of
the
th
congress
i
urge
the
new
congressas
it
undertakes
broad
efforts
to
strengthen
the
economy
as
well
as
more
specific
tasks
like
reauthorizing
the
vocational
education
actto
make
the
needs
of
our
nations
unemployed
youth
a
top
priority
for
action
only
by
combining
a
basic
skills
education
program
together
with
work
training
and
employment
incentives
can
we
make
substantial
progress
in
eliminating
one
of
the
most
severe
social
problems
in
our
nationyouth
unemployment
particularly
among
minorities
i
am
proud
of
the
progress
already
made
through
passage
of
the
youth
employment
and
demonstration
project
act
of
and
the
substantial
increase
in
our
investment
in
youth
employment
programs
the
new
legislation
would
cap
these
efforts
income
security
social
security
one
of
the
highest
priorities
of
my
administration
has
been
to
continue
the
tradition
of
effectiveness
and
efficiency
widely
associated
with
the
social
security
program
and
to
assure
present
and
future
beneficiaries
that
they
will
receive
their
benefits
as
expected
the
earned
benefits
that
are
paid
monthly
to
retired
and
disabled
american
workers
and
their
families
provide
a
significant
measure
of
economic
protection
to
millions
of
people
who
might
otherwise
face
retirement
or
possible
disability
with
fear
i
have
enacted
changes
to
improve
the
benefits
of
many
social
security
beneficiaries
during
my
years
as
president
the
last
four
years
have
presented
a
special
set
of
concerns
over
the
financial
stability
of
the
social
security
system
shortly
after
taking
office
i
proposed
and
congress
enacted
legislation
to
protect
the
stability
of
the
old
age
and
survivors
trust
fund
and
prevent
the
imminent
exhaustion
of
the
disability
insurance
trust
fund
and
to
correct
a
flaw
in
the
benefit
formula
that
was
threatening
the
long
run
health
of
the
entire
social
security
system
the
actions
taken
by
the
congress
at
my
request
helped
stabilize
the
system
that
legislation
was
later
complemented
by
the
disability
insurance
amendments
of
which
further
bolstered
the
disability
insurance
program
and
reduced
certain
inequities
among
beneficiaries
my
commitment
to
the
essential
retirement
and
disability
protection
provided
to
million
people
each
month
has
been
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
without
interruption
those
beneficiaries
have
continued
to
receive
their
social
security
benefits
including
annual
cost
of
living
increases
changing
and
unpredictable
economic
circumstances
require
that
we
continue
to
monitor
the
financial
stability
of
the
social
security
system
to
correct
anticipated
shortterm
strains
on
the
system
i
proposed
last
year
that
the
three
funds
be
allowed
to
borrow
from
one
another
and
i
urge
the
congress
again
this
year
to
adopt
such
interfund
borrowing
to
further
strengthen
the
social
security
system
and
provide
a
greater
degree
of
assurance
to
beneficiaries
given
projected
future
economic
uncertainties
additional
action
should
be
taken
among
the
additional
financing
options
available
are
borrowing
from
the
general
fund
financing
half
of
the
hospital
insurance
fund
with
general
revenues
and
increasing
the
payroll
tax
rate
the
latter
option
is
particularly
unpalatable
given
the
significant
increase
in
the
tax
rate
already
mandated
in
law
this
administration
continues
to
oppose
cuts
in
basic
social
security
benefits
and
taxing
social
security
benefits
the
administration
continues
to
support
annual
indexing
of
social
security
benefits
welfare
reform
in
i
proposed
a
welfare
reform
package
which
offers
solutions
to
some
of
the
most
urgent
problems
in
our
welfare
system
this
proposal
is
embodied
in
two
bills
the
work
and
training
opportunities
act
and
the
social
welfare
reform
amendments
act
the
house
passed
the
second
of
these
two
proposals
within
the
framework
of
our
present
welfare
system
my
reform
proposals
offer
achievable
means
to
increase
selfsufficiency
through
work
rather
than
welfare
more
adequate
assistance
to
people
unable
to
work
the
removal
of
inequities
in
coverage
under
current
programs
and
fiscal
relief
needed
by
states
and
localities
our
current
welfare
system
is
long
overdue
for
serious
reform
the
system
is
wasteful
and
not
fully
effective
the
legislation
i
have
proposed
will
help
eliminate
inequities
by
establishing
a
national
minimum
benefit
and
by
directly
relating
benefit
levels
to
the
poverty
threshold
it
will
reduce
program
complexity
which
leads
to
inefficiency
and
waste
by
simplifying
and
coordinating
administration
among
different
programs
i
urge
the
congress
to
take
action
in
this
area
along
the
lines
i
have
recommended
child
welfare
my
administration
has
worked
closely
with
the
congress
on
legislation
which
is
designed
to
improve
greatly
the
child
welfare
services
and
foster
care
programs
and
to
create
a
federal
system
of
adoption
assistance
these
improvements
will
be
achieved
with
the
recent
enactment
of
hr
the
adoption
assistance
and
child
welfare
act
of
the
wellbeing
of
children
in
need
of
homes
and
their
permanent
placement
have
been
a
primary
concern
of
my
administration
this
legislation
will
ensure
that
children
are
not
lost
in
the
foster
care
system
but
instead
will
be
returned
to
their
families
where
possible
or
placed
in
permanent
adoptive
homes
lowincome
energy
assistance
in
i
proposed
a
program
to
provide
an
annual
total
of
billion
to
lowincome
households
which
are
hardest
hit
by
rising
energy
bills
with
the
cooperation
of
congress
we
were
able
to
move
quickly
to
provide
assistance
to
eligible
households
in
time
to
meet
their
winter
heating
bills
in
response
to
the
extreme
heat
conditions
affecting
many
parts
of
the
country
during
i
directed
the
community
services
administration
to
make
available
over
million
to
assist
lowincome
individuals
especially
the
elderly
facing
life
threatening
circumstances
due
to
extreme
heat
congress
amended
and
reauthorized
the
lowincome
energy
assistance
program
for
fiscal
year
and
provided
billion
to
meet
anticipated
increasing
need
the
need
for
a
program
to
help
lowincome
households
with
rising
energy
expenses
will
not
abate
in
the
near
future
the
lowincome
energy
assistance
program
should
be
reauthorized
to
meet
those
needs
housing
for
the
past
months
high
interest
rates
have
had
a
severe
impact
on
the
nations
housing
market
yet
the
current
pressures
and
uncertainties
should
not
obscure
the
achievements
of
the
past
four
years
working
with
the
congress
the
regulatory
agencies
and
the
financial
community
my
administration
has
brought
about
an
expanded
and
steadier
flow
of
funds
into
home
mortgages
deregulation
of
the
interest
rates
payable
by
depository
institutions
the
evolution
of
variable
and
renegotiated
rate
mortgages
development
of
high
yielding
savings
certificates
and
expansion
of
the
secondary
mortgage
market
have
all
increased
housings
ability
to
attract
capital
and
have
assured
that
mortgage
money
would
not
be
cut
off
when
interest
rates
rose
these
actions
will
diminish
the
cyclicality
of
the
housing
industry
further
we
have
secured
legislation
updating
the
federal
governments
emergency
authority
to
provide
support
for
the
housing
industry
through
the
brookecranston
program
and
creating
a
new
section
housing
stimulus
program
these
tools
will
enable
the
federal
government
to
deal
quickly
and
effectively
with
serious
distress
in
this
critical
industry
we
have
also
worked
to
expand
homeownership
opportunities
for
americans
by
using
innovative
financing
mechanisms
such
as
the
graduated
payment
mortgage
we
have
increased
the
access
of
middle
income
families
to
housing
credit
by
revitalizing
the
section
program
we
have
enabled
nearly
moderate
income
households
to
purchase
new
homes
by
reducing
paperwork
and
regulation
in
federal
programs
and
by
working
with
state
and
local
governments
to
ease
the
regulatory
burden
we
have
helped
to
hold
down
housing
costs
and
produce
affordable
housing
as
a
result
of
these
governmentwide
efforts
million
more
american
families
bought
homes
in
the
past
four
years
than
in
any
equivalent
period
in
history
and
more
than
million
homes
have
begun
construction
during
my
administration
million
more
than
in
the
previous
four
years
we
have
devoted
particular
effort
to
meeting
the
housing
needs
of
low
and
moderate
income
families
in
the
past
four
years
more
than
million
subsidized
units
have
been
made
available
for
occupancy
by
lower
income
americans
and
more
than
assisted
units
have
gone
into
construction
in
addition
we
have
undertaken
a
series
of
measures
to
revitalize
and
preserve
the
nations
million
units
of
public
and
assisted
housing
for
fiscal
year
i
am
proposing
to
continue
our
commitment
to
lower
income
housing
i
am
requesting
funds
to
support
units
of
section
and
public
housing
maintaining
these
programs
at
the
level
provided
by
congress
in
fiscal
while
we
have
made
progress
in
the
past
four
years
in
the
future
there
are
reasons
for
concern
home
price
inflation
and
high
interest
rates
threaten
to
put
homeownership
out
of
reach
for
firsttime
homebuyers
lower
income
households
the
elderly
and
those
dependent
upon
rental
housing
face
rising
rents
low
levels
of
rental
housing
construction
by
historic
standards
and
the
threat
of
displacement
due
to
conversion
to
condominiums
and
other
factors
housing
will
face
strong
competition
for
investment
capital
from
the
industrial
sector
generally
and
the
energy
industries
in
particular
to
address
these
issues
i
appointed
a
presidential
task
force
and
advisory
group
last
october
while
this
effort
will
not
proceed
due
to
the
election
result
i
hope
the
incoming
administration
will
proceed
with
a
similar
venture
the
most
important
action
government
can
take
to
meet
americas
housing
needs
is
to
restore
stability
to
the
economy
and
bring
down
the
rate
of
inflation
inflation
has
driven
up
home
prices
operating
costs
and
interest
rates
market
uncertainty
about
inflation
has
contributed
to
the
instability
in
interest
rates
which
has
been
an
added
burden
to
homebuilders
and
homebuyers
alike
by
making
a
longterm
commitment
to
provide
a
framework
for
greater
investment
sustained
economic
growth
and
price
stability
my
administration
has
begun
the
work
of
creating
a
healthy
environment
for
housing
transportation
with
the
passage
of
the
airline
deregulation
act
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
and
the
harley
o
staggers
rail
act
of
my
administration
working
with
the
congress
has
initiated
a
new
era
of
reduced
regulation
of
transportation
industries
deregulation
will
lead
to
increased
productivity
and
operating
efficiencies
in
the
industries
involved
and
stimulate
price
and
service
competition
to
the
benefit
of
consumers
generally
i
urge
the
new
administration
to
continue
our
efforts
on
behalf
of
deregulation
legislation
for
the
intercity
passenger
bus
industry
as
well
in
the
coming
decade
the
most
significant
challenge
facing
the
nation
in
transportation
services
will
be
to
improve
a
deteriorating
physical
infrastructure
of
roadways
railroads
waterways
and
mass
transit
systems
in
order
to
conserve
costly
energy
supplies
while
promoting
effective
transportation
services
highways
our
vast
network
of
highways
which
account
for
percent
of
travel
and
percent
by
value
of
freight
traffic
goods
movement
is
deteriorating
if
current
trends
continue
a
major
proportion
of
the
interstate
pavement
will
have
deteriorated
by
the
end
of
the
s
arresting
the
deterioration
of
the
nations
system
of
highways
is
a
high
priority
objective
for
the
s
we
must
reorient
the
federal
mission
from
major
new
construction
projects
to
the
stewardship
of
the
existing
interstate
highway
system
interstate
gaps
should
be
judged
on
the
connections
they
make
and
on
their
compatibility
with
community
needs
during
this
decade
highway
investments
will
be
needed
to
increase
productivity
particularly
in
the
elimination
of
bottlenecks
provide
more
efficient
connections
to
ports
and
seek
lowcost
solutions
to
traffic
demand
my
administration
has
therefore
recommended
redefining
completion
of
the
interstate
system
consolidating
over
categorical
assistance
programs
into
nine
and
initiating
a
major
repair
and
rehabilitation
program
for
segments
of
the
interstate
system
this
effort
should
help
maintain
the
condition
and
performance
of
the
nations
highways
particularly
the
interstate
and
primary
system
provide
a
realistic
means
to
complete
the
interstate
system
by
ensure
better
program
delivery
through
consolidation
and
assist
urban
revitalization
in
addition
the
congress
must
address
the
urgent
funding
problems
of
the
highway
trust
fund
and
the
need
to
generate
greater
revenues
mass
transit
in
the
past
decade
the
nations
public
transit
systems
ridership
increased
at
an
annual
average
of
each
year
in
the
s
in
continued
increases
in
the
cost
of
fuel
are
expected
to
make
transit
a
growing
part
of
the
nations
transportation
system
as
a
result
my
administration
projected
a
ten
year
billion
program
to
increase
mass
transit
capacity
by
percent
and
promote
more
energy
efficient
vehicle
uses
in
the
next
decade
the
first
part
of
this
proposal
was
the
five
year
billion
urban
mass
transportation
administration
reauthorization
legislation
i
sent
to
the
congress
in
march
i
urge
the
th
congress
to
quickly
enact
this
or
similar
legislation
in
my
administration
was
also
the
first
to
have
proposed
and
signed
into
law
a
nonurban
formula
grant
program
to
assist
rural
areas
and
small
communities
with
public
transportation
programs
to
end
their
dependence
on
the
automobile
promote
energy
conservation
and
efficiency
and
provide
transportation
services
to
impoverished
rural
communities
a
principal
need
of
the
s
will
be
maintaining
mobility
for
all
segments
of
the
population
in
the
face
of
severely
increasing
transportation
costs
and
uncertainty
of
fuel
supplies
we
must
improve
the
flexibility
of
our
transportation
system
and
offer
greater
choice
and
diversity
in
transportation
services
while
the
private
automobile
will
continue
to
be
the
principal
means
of
transportation
for
many
americans
public
transportation
can
become
an
increasingly
attractive
alternative
we
therefore
want
to
explore
a
variety
of
paratransit
modes
various
types
of
buses
modern
rapid
transit
regional
rail
systems
and
light
rail
systems
highway
planning
and

must
be
integrated
and
related
to

now
in

the

of
many

to
support

elderly

transportation
policies
in
the
s
must
pay
increasing
attention
to
the
needs
of
the
elderly

by
the
number
of
people
over

have
grown
from

during
the

period
the
number
of

using
transit
as
well
as

including
the
elderlyis
expected
to
increase
from
to
million
making
up

of
the
population
we
must
not
retreat
from
a
policy
that
affords
a
significant
and
growing
portion
of
our
population
accessible
public
transportation
while
recognizing
that
the
handicapped
are
a
diverse
group
and
will
need
flexible
doortodoor
service
where
regular
public
transportation
will
not
do
the
job
railroads
in
addition
the
federal
government
must
reassess
the
appropriate
federal
role
of
support
for
passenger
and
freight
rail
services
such
as
amtrak
and
conrail
our
goal
through
federal
assistance
should
be
to
maintain
and
enhance
adequate
rail
service
where
it
is
not
otherwise
available
to
needy
communities
but
federal
subsidies
must
be
closely
scrutinized
to
be
sure
they
are
a
stimulus
to
and
not
a
replacement
for
private
investment
and
initiative
federal

cannot
mean
permanent
subsidies
for
unprofitable
operations
waterways
and
rural
transportation
there
is
a
growing
need
in
rural
and
small
communities
for
improved
transportation
services
rail
freight
service
to
many
communities
has
declined
as
railroads
abandon
unproductive
branch
lines
at
the
same
time
rural
roads
are
often
inadequate
to
handle
large
heavilyloaded
trucks
the
increased
demand
for
harvest
to
harbor
service
has
also
placed
an
increased
burden
on
rural
transportation
systems
while
bottlenecks
along
the
mississippi
river
delay
grain
shipments
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
we
have
made
some
progress
to
further
develop
the
nations
waterways
my
administration
began
construction
of
a
new
foot
lock
at
the
site
of
lock
and
dam
on
the
mississippi
river
when
opened
in
the
new

will
have
a
capacity
of
million
tons
per
year
an
percent
increase
over
the
present
system
the
us
army

of
engineers
has
also
undertaken
studies
to
assess
the
feasibility
of
expanding
the
bonneville

rehabilitation
of

completion
of
the
upper
mississippi
river
master
plan
to
determine
the
feasibility
of
constructing
a
second

at

these
efforts
will
help
alleviate
delays
in
transporting
corn

along
the

to
the

the

maritime
policy
during
my
administration
i
have
sought
to
ensure
that
the
us
maritime
industry
will
not
have
to
function
at
an
unfair
competitive
disadvantage
in
the
international
market
as
i
indicated
in
my
maritime
policy
statement
to
the
congress
in
july
the
american
merchant
marine
is
vital
to
our
nations
welfare
and
federal
actions
should
promote
rather
than
harm
it
in
pursuit
of
this
objective
i
signed
into
law
the
controlled
carrier
act
of
authorizing
the
federal
maritime
commission
to
regulate
certain
rate
cutting
practices
of
some
statecontrolled
carriers
and
recently
signed
a
bilateral
maritime
agreement
with
the
peoples
republic
of
china
that
will
expand
the
access
of
american
ships
to
specified
chinese
ports
and
set
aside
for
americanflag
ships
a
substantial
share
at
least
onethird
of
the
cargo
between
our
countries
this
agreement
should
officially
foster
expanded
us
and
chinese
shipping
services
linking
the
two
countries
and
will
provide
further
momentum
to
the
growth
of
sinoamerican
trade
there
is
also
a
need
to
modernize
and
expand
the
dry
bulk
segment
of
our
fleet
our
heavy
dependence
on
foreign
carriage
of
usbulk
cargoes
deprives
the
us
economy
of
seafaring
and
shipbuilding
jobs
adds
to
the
balanceofpayments
deficit
deprives
the
government
of
substantial
tax
revenues
and
leaves
the
united
states
dependent
on
foreignflag
shipping
for
a
continued
supply
of
raw
materials
to
support
the
civil
economy
and
war
production
in
time
of
war
i
therefore
sent
to
the
congress
proposed
legislation
to
strengthen
this
woefully
weak
segment
of
the
usflag
fleet
by
removing
certain
disincentives
to
us
construction
of
dry
bulkers
and
their
operation
under
us
registry
enactment
of
this
proposed
legislation
would
establish
the
basis
for
accelerating
the
rebuilding
of
the
usflag
dry
bulk
fleet
toward
a
level
commensurate
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
the
worlds
leading
bulk
trading
country
during
the
past
year
the
administration
has
stated
its
support
for
legislation
that
would
provide
specific
federal
assistance
for
the
installation
of
fuelefficient
engines
in
existing
american
ships
and
would
strengthen
this
countrys
shipbuilding
mobilization
base
strengthening
the
fleet
is
important
but
we
must
also
maintain
our
shipbuilding
base
for
future
ship
construction
provisions
in
existing
laws
calling
for
substantial
or
exclusive
use
of
americanflag
vessels

special
needs
women
the
past
four
years
have
been
years
of
rapid
advancement
for
women
our
focus
has
been
twofold
to
provide
american
women
with
a
full
range
of
opportunities
and
to
make
them
a
part
of
the
mainstream
of
every
aspect
of
our
national
life
and
leadership
i
have
appointed
a
record
number
of
women
to
judgeships
and
to
top
government
posts
fully
percent
of
all
my
appointees
are
women
and
i
nominated
of
the
women
who
sit
on
the
federal
bench
today
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
women
occupy
policymaking
positions
at
the
highest
level
of
every
federal
agency
and
department
and
have
demonstrated
their
ability
to
serve
our
citizens
well
we
have
strengthened
the
rights
of
employed
women
by
consolidating
and
strengthening
enforcement
of
sex
discrimination
laws
under
the
eeoc
by
expanding
employment
rights
of
pregnant
women
through
the
pregnancy
disability
bill
and
by
increasing
federal
employment
opportunities
for
women
through
civil
service
reform
and
flexitime
and
parttime
employment
by
executive
order
i
created
the
first
national
program
to
provide
women
businessowners
with
technical
assistance
grants
loans
and
improved
access
to
federal
contracts
we
have
been
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
women
who
are
homemakers
i
established
an
office
of
families
within
hhs
and
sponsored
the
white
house
conference
on
families
we
initiated
a
program
targeting
ceta
funds
to
help
displaced
homemakers
the
social
security
system
was
amended
to
eliminate
the
widows
penalty
and
a
comprehensive
study
of
discriminatory
provisions
and
possible
changes
was
presented
to
congress
legislation
was
passed
to
give
divorced
spouses
of
foreign
service
officers
rights
to
share
in
pension
benefits
we
created
an
office
on
domestic
violence
within
hhs
to
coordinate
the
agencies
that
now
have
domestic
violence
relief
programs
and
to
distribute
information
on
the
problem
and
the
services
available
to
victims
despite
a
stringent
budget
for
fy
the
administration
consistently
supported
the
womens
educational
equity
act
and
family
planning
activities
as
well
as
other
programs
that
affect
women
such
as
food
stamps
wic
and
social
security
we
have
been
concerned
not
only
about
the
american
womans
opportunities
but
ensuring
equality
for
women
around
the
world
in
november
i
sent
to
the
senate
the
convention
on
the
elimination
of
all
forms
of
discrimination
against
women
this
united
nations
document
is
the
most
comprehensive
and
detailed
international
agreement
which
seeks
the
advancement
of
women
on
womens
issues
i
have
sought
the
counsel
of
men
and
women
in
and
out
of
government
and
from
all
regions
of
our
country
i
established
two
panels
the
presidents
advisory
committee
for
women
and
the
interdepartmental
task
force
on
womento
advise
me
on
these
issues
the
mandate
for
both
groups
expired
on
december
but
they
have
left
behind
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
status
of
women
in
our
society
today
that
review
provides
excellent
guidance
for
the
work
remaining
in
our
battle
against
sex
discrimination
even
though
we
have
made
progress
much
remains
on
the
agenda
for
women
i
remain
committed
to
the
equal
rights
amendment
and
will
continue
to
work
for
its
passage
it
is
essential
to
the
goal
of
bringing
americas
women
fully
into
the
mainstream
of
american
life
that
the
era
be
ratified
the
efforts
begun
for
women
in
employment
business
and
education
should
be
continued
and
strengthened
money
should
be
available
to
states
to
establish
programs
to
help
the
victims
of
domestic
violence
congress
should
pass
a
national
health
care
plan
and
a
welfare
reform
program
and
these
measures
should
reflect
the
needs
of
women
the
talents
of
women
should
continue
to
be
used
to
the
fullest
inside
and
outside
of
government
and
efforts
should
continue
to
see
that
they
have
the
widest
range
of
opportunities
and
options
handicapped
i
hope
that
my
administration
will
be
remembered
in
this
area
for
leading
the
way
toward
full
civil
rights
for
handicapped
americans
when
i
took
office
no
federal
agency
had
yet
issued
regulations
as
i
leave
office
this
first
step
by
every
major
agency
and
department
in
the
federal
government
is
almost
complete
but
it
is
only
a
first
step
the
years
ahead
will
require
steadfast
dedication
by
the
president
to
protect
and
promote
these
precious
rights
in
the
classroom
in
the
workplace
and
in
all
public
facilities
so
that
handicapped
individuals
may
join
the
american
mainstream
and
contribute
to
the
fullest
their
resources
and
talents
to
our
economic
and
social
life
just
as
we
supported
in
an
unprecedented
way
the
civil
rights
of
disabled
persons
in
schools
and
in
the
workplace
other
initiatives
in
health
prevention
such
as
our
immunization
and
nutrition
programs
for
young
children
and
new
intense
efforts
to
reverse
spinal
cord
injury
must
continue
so
that
the
incidence
of
disability
continues
to
decline
this
year
is
the
undeclared
international
year
of
disabled
persons
we
are
organizing
activities
to
celebrate
and
promote
this
important
commemorative
year
within
the
government
as
well
as
in
cooperation
with
private
sector
efforts
in
this
country
and
around
the
world
the
international
year
will
give
our
country
the
opportunity
to
recognize
the
talents
and
capabilities
of
our
fellow
citizens
with
disabilities
we
can
also
share
our
rehabilitation
and
treatment
skills
with
other
countries
and
learn
from
them
as
well
i
am
proud
that
the
united
states
leads
the
world
in
mainstreaming
and
treating
disabled
people
however
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
all
psychological
and
physical
barriers
to
disabled
people
are
torn
down
and
they
can
be
full
participants
in
our
american
way
of
life
we
must
pledge
our
full
commitment
to
this
goal
during
the
international
year
families
because
of
my
concern
for
american
families
my
administration
convened
last
year
the
first
white
house
conference
on
families
which
involved
seven
national
hearings
over
state
and
local
events
three
white
house
conferences
and
the
direct
participation
of
more
than
citizens
the
conference
reaffirmed
the
centrality
of
families
in
our
lives
and
nation
but
documented
problems
american
families
face
as
well
we
also
established
the
office
of
families
within
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
to
review
government
policies
and
programs
that
affect
families
i
expect
the
departments
and
agencies
within
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
as
well
as
members
of
congress
corporate
and
business
leaders
and
state
and
local
officials
across
the
country
to
study
closely
the
recommendations
of
the
white
house
conference
and
implement
them
appropriately
as
public
policy
is
developed
and
implemented
by
the
federal
government
cognizance
of
the
work
of
the
conference
should
be
taken
as
a
pragmatic
and
essential
step
the
conference
has
done
a
good
job
of
establishing
an
agenda
for
action
to
assure
that
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
are
more
sensitive
in
their
impact
on
families
i
hope
the
congress
will
review
and
seriously
consider
the
conferences
recommendations
older
americans
my
administration
has
taken
great
strides
toward
solving
the
difficult
problems
faced
by
older
americans
early
in
my
term
we
worked
successfully
with
the
congress
to
assure
adequate
revenues
for
the
social
security
trust
funds
and
last
year
the
strength
of
the
social
security
system
was
strengthened
by
legislation
i
proposed
to
permit
borrowing
among
the
separate
trust
funds
i
have
also
signed
into
law
legislation
prohibiting
employers
from
requiring
retirement
prior
to
age
and
removing
mandatory
retirement
for
most
federal
employees
in
addition
my
administration
worked
very
closely
with
congress
to
amend
the
older
americans
act
in
a
way
that
has
already
improved
administration
of
its
housing
social
services
food
delivery
and
employment
programs
this
year
i
will
be
submitting
to
congress
a
budget
which
again
demonstrates
my
commitment
to
programs
for
the
elderly
it
will
include
as
my
previous
budgets
have
increased
funding
for
nutrition
senior
centers
and
home
health
care
and
will
focus
added
resources
on
the
needs
of
older
americans
with
the
white
house
conference
on
aging
approaching
i
hope
the
new
administration
will
make
every
effort
to
assure
an
effective
and
useful
conference
this
conference
should
enable
older
americans
to
voice
their
concerns
and
give
us
guidance
in
our
continued
efforts
to
ensure
the
quality
of
life
so
richly
deserved
by
our
senior
citizens
refugees
we
cannot
hope
to
build
a
just
and
humane
society
at
home
if
we
ignore
the
humanitarian
claims
of
refugees
their
lives
at
stake
who
have
nowhere
else
to
turn
our
country
can
be
proud
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
around
the
world
would
risk
everything
they
haveincluding
their
own
livesto
come
to
our
country
this
administration
initiated
and
implemented
the
first
comprehensive
reform
of
our
refugee
and
immigration
policies
in
over
years
we
also
established
the
first
refugee
coordination
office
in
the
department
of
state
under
the
leadership
of
a
special
ambassador
and
coordinator
for
refugee
affairs
and
programs
the
new
legislation
and
the
coordinators
office
will
bring
common
sense
and
consolidation
to
our
nations
previously
fragmented
inconsistent
and
in
many
ways
outdated
refugee
and
immigration
policies
with
the
unexpected
arrival
of
thousands
of
cubans
and
haitians
who
sought
refuge
in
our
country
last
year
outside
of
our
regular
immigration
and
refugee
admissions
process
our
country
and
its
government
were
tested
in
being
compassionate
and
responsive
to
a
major
human
emergency
because
we
had
taken
steps
to
reorganize
our
refugee
programs
we
met
that
test
successfully
i
am
proud
that
the
american
people
responded
to
this
crisis
with
their
traditional
good
will
and
hospitality
also
we
would
never
have
been
able
to
handle
this
unprecedented
emergency
without
the
efforts
of
the
private
resettlement
agencies
who
have
always
been
there
to
help
refugees
in
crises
immigrants
to
this
country
always
contribute
more
toward
making
our
country
stronger
than
they
ever
take
from
the
system
i
am
confident
that
the
newest
arrivals
to
our
country
will
carry
on
this
tradition
while
we
must
remain
committed
to
aiding
and
assisting
those
who
come
to
our
shores
at
the
same
time
we
must
uphold
our
immigration
and
refugee
policies
and
provide
adequate
enforcement
resources
as
a
result
of
our
enforcement
policy
the
illegal
flow
from
cuba
has
been
halted
and
an
orderly
process
has
been
initiated
to
make
certain
that
our
refugee
and
immigration
laws
are
honored
this
year
the
select
commission
on
immigration
and
refugee
policy
will
complete
its
work
and
forward
its
advice
and
recommendations
i
hope
that
the
recommendations
will
be
carefully
considered
by
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
for
it
is
clear
that
we
must
take
additional
action
to
keep
our
immigration
policy
responsive
to
emergencies
and
ever
changing
times
veterans
this
country
and
its
leadership
has
a
continuing
and
unique
obligation
to
the
men
and
women
who
served
their
nation
in
the
armed
forces
and
help
maintain
or
restore
peace
in
the
world
my
commitment
to
veterans
as
evidenced
by
my
record
is
characterized
by
a
conscientious
and
consistent
emphasis
in
these
general
areas
first
we
have
worked
to
honor
the
vietnam
veteran
during
my
administration
and
under
the
leadership
of
va
administrator
max
cleland
i
was
proud
to
lead
our
country
in
an
overdue
acknowledgement
of
our
nations
gratitude
to
the
men
and
women
who
served
their
country
during
the
bitter
war
in
southeast
asia
their
homecoming
was
deferred
and
seemed
doomed
to
be
ignored
our
country
has
matured
in
the
last
four
years
and
at
long
last
we
were
able
to
separate
the
war
from
the
warrior
and
honor
these
veterans
but
with
our
acknowledgement
of
their
service
goes
an
understanding
that
some
vietnam
veterans
have
unique
needs
and
problems
my
administration
was
able
to
launch
a
long
sought
after
psychological
readjustment
and
outreach
program
unprecedented
in
its
popularity
sensitivity
and
success
this
program
must
be
continued
the
administration
has
also
grappled
with
the
difficult
questions
posed
by
some
veterans
who
served
in
southeast
asia
and
were
exposed
to
potentially
harmful
substances
including
the
herbicide
known
as
agent
orange
we
have
launched
scientific
inquiries
that
should
answer
many
veterans
questions
about
their
health
and
should
provide
the
basis
for
establishing
sound
compensation
policy
we
cannot
rest
until
their
concerns
are
dealt
with
in
a
sensitive
expeditious
and
compassionate
fashion
second
we
have
focused
the
va
health
care
system
in
the
needs
of
the
serviceconnected
disabled
veteran
we
initiated
and
are
implementing
the
first
reform
of
the
va
vocational
rehabilitation
system
since
its
inception
in
also
my
administration
was
the
first
to
seek
a
costofliving
increase
for
the
recipients
of
va
compensation
every
year
my
last
budget
also
makes
such
a
request
the
administration
also
launched
the
disabled
veterans
outreach
program
in
the
department
of
labor
which
has
successfully
placed
disabled
veterans
in
jobs
services
provided
by
the
va
health
care
system
will
be
further
targeted
to
the
special
needs
of
disabled
veterans
during
the
coming
year
third
the
va
health
care
system
the
largest
in
the
free
world
has
maintained
its
independence
and
high
quality
during
my
administration
we
have
made
the
system
more
efficient
and
have
therefore
treated
more
veterans
than
ever
before
by
concentrating
on
outpatient
care
and
through
modern
management
improvements
as
the
median
age
of
the
american
veteran
population
increases
we
must
concentrate
on
further
changes
within
the
va
system
to
keep
it
independent
and
to
serve
as
a
model
to
the
nation
and
to
the
world
as
a
center
for
research
treatment
and
rehabilitation
government
assistance
general
aid
to
state
and
local
governments
since
taking
office
i
have
been
strongly
committed
to
strengthening
the
fiscal
and
economic
condition
of
our
nations
state
and
local
governments
i
have
accomplished
this
goal
by
encouraging

by
supporting

other
essential
grantinaid
programs
grantsinaid
to
states

during
my

total

to
state

have
increased
by
more
than
percent
from
billion
in
fiscal
year
to
billion
in
fiscal
year
this
significant
increase
in
aid
has
allowed
states
and
localities
to
maintain
services
that
are
essential
to
their
citizens
without
imposing
onerous
tax
burdens
it
also
has
allowed
us
to
establish
an
unprecedented
partnership
between
the
leaders
of
the
federal
government
and
state
and
local
government
elected
officials
general
revenue
sharing
last
year
congress
enacted
legislation
that
extends
the
general
revenue
sharing
program
for
three
more
years
this
program
is
the
cornerstone
of
our
efforts
to
maintain
the
fiscal
health
of
our
nations
local
government
it
will
provide
billion
in
each
of
the
next
three
years
to
cities
counties
and
towns
this
program
is
essential
to
the
continued
ability
of
our
local
governments
to
provide
essential
police
fire
and
sanitation
services
this
legislation
renewing
grs
will
be
the
cornerstone
of
federalstatelocal
government
relations
in
the
s
this
policy
will
emphasize
the
need
for
all
levels
of
government
to
cooperate
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
most
fiscally
strained
cities
and
counties
and
also
will
emphasize
the
important
role
that
grs
can
play
in
forging
this
partnership
i
am
grateful
that
congress
moved
quickly
to
assure
that
our
nations
localities
can
begin
the
s
in
sound
fiscal
condition
countercyclical
assistance
last
year
i
proposed
that
congress
enact
a
billion
countercyclical
fiscal
assistance
program
to
protect
states
and
localities
from
unexpected
changes
in
the
national
economy
this
program
unfortunately
was
not
enacted
by
the
full
congress
i
therefore
have
not
included
funding
for
countercyclical
aid
in
my
fiscal
year
budget
nevertheless
i
urge
congress
to
enact
a
permanent
standby
countercyclical
program
so
that
states
and
cities
can
be
protected
during
the
next
economic
downturn
urban
policy
three
years
ago
i
proposed
the
nations
first
comprehensive
urban
policy
that
policy
involved
more
than
one
hundred
improvements
in
existing
federal
programs
four
new
executive
orders
and
nineteen
pieces
of
urbanoriented
legislation
with
congress
cooperation
sixteen
of
these
bills
have
now
been
signed
into
law
economic
development
one
of
the
principal
goals
of
my
domestic
policy
has
been
to
strengthen
the
private
sector
economic
base
of
our
nations
economically
troubled
urban
and
rural
areas
with
congress
cooperation
we
have
substantially
expanded
the
federal
governments
economic
development
programs
and
provided
new
tax
incentives
for
private
investment
in
urban
and
rural
communities
these
programs
have
helped
many
communities
to
attract
new
private
sector
jobs
and
investments
and
to
retain
the
jobs
and
investments
that
already
are
in
place
when
i
took
office
the
federal
government
was
spending
less
than
million
annually
on
economic
development
programs
and
only
million
of
those
funds
in
our
nations
urban
areas
since
that
time
we
have
created
the
urban
development
action
grant
udag
program
and
substantially
expanded
the
economic
development
programs
in
the
commerce
department
my
fy
budget
requests
more
than
billion
for
economic
development
grants
loans
and
interest
subsidies
and
almost
billion
for
loan
guarantees
approximately
percent
of
these
funds
will
be
spent
in
our
nations
urban
areas
in
addition
we
have
extended
the
percent
investment
credit
to
include
rehabilitation
of
existing
industrial
facilities
as
well
as
new
construction
i
continue
to
believe
that
the
development
of
private
sector
investment
and
jobs
is
the
key
to
revitalizing
our
nations
economically
depressed
urban
and
rural
areas
to
ensure
that
the
necessary
economic
development
goes
forward
the
congress
must
continue
to
provide
strong
support
for
the
udag
program
and
the
programs
for
the
economic
development
administration
those
programs
provide
a
foundation
for
the
economic
development
of
our
nation
in
the
s
community
development
the
partnership
among
federal
state
and
local
governments
to
revitalize
our
nations
communities
has
been
a
high
priority
of
my
administration
when
i
took
office
i
proposed
a
substantial
expansion
of
the
community
development
block
grant
cdbg
program
and
the
enactment
of
a
new
million
urban
development
action
grant
udag
program
both
of
these
programs
have
provided
essential
community
and
economic
development
assistance
to
our
nations
cities
and
counties
last
year
congress
reauthorized
both
the
cdbg
and
udag
programs
the
cdbg
program
was
reauthorized
for
three
more
years
with
annual
funding
increases
of
million
and
the
udag
program
was
extended
for
three
years
at
the
current
funding
level
of
million
annually
my
budget
requests
full
funding
for
both
of
these
programs
these
actions
should
help
our
nations
cities
and
counties
to
continue
the
progress
they
have
made
in
the
last
three
years
neighborhoods
during
my
administration
we
have
taken
numerous
positive
steps
to
achieve
a
full
partnership
of
neighborhood
organizations
and
government
at
all
levels
we
have
successfully
fought
against
red
lining
and
housing
discrimination
we
created
innovative
self
help
funding
and
technical
resource
transfer
mechanisms
we
have
created
unique
methods
of
access
for
neighborhood
organizations
to
have
a
participating
role
in
federal
and
state
government
decisionmaking
neighborhood
based
organizations
are
the
threshold
of
the
american
community
the
federal
government
will
need
to
develop
more
innovative
and
practical
ways
for
neighborhood
based
organizations
to
successfully
participate
in
the
identification
and
solution
of
local
and
neighborhood
concerns
full
partnership
will
only
be
achieved
with
the
knowing
participation
of
leaders
of
government
business
education
and
unions
neither
state
nor
federal
solutions
imposed
from
on
high
will
suffice
neighborhoods
are
the
fabric
and
soul
of
this
great
land
neighborhoods
define
the
weave
that
has
been
used
to
create
a
permanent
fabric
the
federal
government
must
take
every
opportunity
to
provide
access
and
influence
to
the
individuals
and
organizations
affected
at
the
neighborhood
level
rural
policy
since
the
beginning
of
my
administration
i
have
been
committed
to
improving
the
effectiveness
with
which
the
federal
government
deals
with
the
problems
and
needs
of
a
rapidly
changing
rural
america
the
rapid
growth
of
some
rural
areas
has
placed
a
heavy
strain
on
communities
and
their
resources
there
are
also
persistent
problems
of
poverty
and
economic
stagnation
in
other
parts
of
rural
america
some
rural
areas
continue
to
lose
population
as
they
have
for
the
past
several
decades
in
december
i
announced
the
small
community
and
rural
development
policy
it
was
the
culmination
of
several
years
work
and
was
designed
to
address
the
varying
needs
of
our
rural
population
in
my
administration
worked
with
the
congress
to
pass
the
rural
development
policy
act
of
which
when
fully
implemented
will
allow
us
to
meet
the
needs
of
rural
people
and
their
communities
more
effectively
and
more
efficiently
as
a
result
of
the
policy
and
the
accompanying
legislation
we
have
created
the
position
of
under
secretary
of
agriculture
for
small
community
and
rural
development
to
provide
overall
leadership
established
a
white
house
working
group
to
assist
in
the
implementation
of
the
policy
worked
with
more
than
governors
to
form
state
rural
development
councils
to
work
in
partnership
with
the
white
house
working
group
and
the
federal
agencies
to
better
deliver
state
and
federal
programs
to
rural
areas
directed
the
white
house
working
group
to
annually
review
existing
and
proposed
policies
programs
and
budget
levels
to
determine
their
adequacy
in
meeting
rural
needs
and
the
fulfilling
of
the
policys
objectives
and
principles
this
effort
on
the
part
of
my
administration
and
the
congress
has
resulted
in
a
landmark
policy
for
the
first
time
rural
affairs
has
received
the
prominence
it
has
always
deserved
it
is
a
policy
that
can
truly
help
alleviate
the
diverse
and
differing
problems
rural
america
will
face
in
the
s
with
the
help
and
dedication
of
a
great
many
people
around
the
country
who
are
concerned
with
rural
affairs
we
have
constructed
a
mechanism
for
dealing
effectively
with
rural
problems
there
is
now
a
great
opportunity
to
successfully
combine
federal
efforts
with
the
efforts
of
rural
community
leaders
and
residents
it
is
my
hope
this
spirit
of
cooperation
and
record
of
accomplishment
will
be
continued
in
the
coming
years
consumers
in
september
i
signed
an
executive
order
designed
to
strengthen
and
coordinate
federal
consumer
programs
and
to
establish
procedures
to
improve
and
facilitate
consumer
participation
in
government
decisionmaking
forty
federal
agencies
have
adopted
programs
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
order
these
programs
will
improve
complaint
handling
provide
better
information
to
consumers
enhance
opportunities
for
public
participation
in
government
proceedings
and
assure
that
the
consumer
point
of
view
is
considered
in
all
programs
policies
and
regulations
while
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
assuring
a
consumer
presence
in
federal
agencies
work
must
continue
to
meet
fully
the
goals
of
the
executive
order
close
monitoring
of
agency
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
order
is
necessary
continued
evaluation
to
assure
that
the
programs
are
effective
and
making
maximum
use
of
available
resources
is
also
essential
as
a
complement
to
these
initiatives
efforts
to
provide
financial
assistance
in
regulatory
proceedings
to
citizen
groups
small
businesses
and
others
whose
participation
is
limited
by
their
economic
circumstances
must
continue
to
be
pursued
it
is
essential
that
consumer
representatives
in
government
pay
particular
attention
to

our
society
to

should
be
found
to
help
foster
this
new

which
is
founded
on
the
principle
of

science
and

science
and
technology
contribute
immeasurably
to
the
lives
of
all
americans
our
high
standard
of
living
is
largely
the
product
of
the
technology
that
surrounds
us
in
the
home
or
factory
our
good
health
is
due
in
large
part
to
our
ever
increasing
scientific
understanding
our
national
security
is
assured
by
the
application
pate
science
and
technology
will
bring
the
federal
government
has
a
special
role
to
play
in
science
and
technology
although
the
fruits
of
scientific
achievements
surround
us
it
is
often
difficult
to
predict
the
benefits
that
will
arise
from
a
given
scientific
venture
and
these
benefits
even
if
predictable
do
not
usually
lead
to
ownership
rights
accordingly
the
government
has
a
special
obligation
to
support
science
as
an
investment
in
our
future
my
administration
has
sought
to
reverse
a
decadelong
decline
in
funding
despite
the
need
for
fiscal
restraint
real
support
of
basic
research
has
grown
nearly
during
my
term
in
office
and
my
administration
has
sought
to
increase
the
support
of
longterm
research
in
the
variety
of
mission
agencies
in
this
way
we
can
harness
the
american
genius
for
innovation
to
meet
the
economic
energy
health
and
security
challenges
that
confront
our
nation
international
relations
and
national
security
science
and
technology
are
becoming
increasingly
important
elements
of
our
national
security
and
foreign
policies
this
is
especially
so
in
the
current
age
of
sophisticated
defense
systems
and
of
growing
dependence
among
all
countries
on
modern
technology
for
all
aspects
of
their
economic
strength
for
these
reasons
scientific
and
technological
considerations
have
been
integral
elements
of
the
administrations
decisionmaking
on
such
national
security
and
foreign
policy
issues
as
the
modernization
of
our
strategic
weaponry
arms
control
technology
transfer
the
growing
bilateral
relationship
with

and
our
relations
with
the

themes
have

at
my
direction
my
science
and

adviser
has
actively
pursued
international
programs
in
support
of
these
four
themes
we
have
given
special
attention
to
scientific
and
technical
relations
with
china
to
new
forms
of
scientific
and
technical
cooperation
with
japan
to

latin
american
and
caribbean
countries
and
several
states
in
black
america
and
to
the
proposed
institute
for
scientific
and
technological
cooperation
in
particular
our
cooperation
with
developing
countries
reflects
the
importance
that
each
of
them
has
placed
on
the
relationship
between
economic
growth
and
scientific
and
technological
capability
it
also
reflects
their
view
that
the
great
strength
of
the
us
in
science
and
technology
makes
close
relations
with
the
us
technical
community
an
especially
productive
means
of
enhancing
this
capability
scientific
and
technological
assistance
is
a
key
linkage
between
the
us
and
the
developing
world
a
linkage
that
has
been
underutilized
in
the
past
and
one
which
we
must
continue
to
work
to
strengthen
space
policy
the
administration
has
established
a
framework
for
a
strong
and
evolving
space
program
for
the
s
the
administrations
space
policy
reaffirmed
the
separation
of
military
space
systems
and
the
open
civil
space
program
and
at
the
same
time
provided
new
guidance
on
technology
transfer
between
the
civil
and
military
programs
the
civil
space
program
centers
on
three
basic
tenets
first
our
space
policy
will
reflect
a
balanced
strategy
of
applications
science
and
technology
development
second
activities
will
be
pursued
when
they
can
be
uniquely
or
more
efficiently
accomplished
in
space
third
a
premature
commitment
to
a
high
challenge

there
will
be
added
flexibility

the
shuttle
dominates
our
technology
development
effort
and
correctly
so
it
represents
one
of
the
most
sophisticated
technological
challenges
ever
undertaken
and
as
a
result
has
encountered
technical
problems
nonetheless
the
first
manned
orbital
flight
is
now
scheduled
for
march
i
have
been
pleased
to
support
strongly
the
necessary
funds
for
the
shuttle
throughout
my
administration
space
applications
since
the
us
has
conducted
experimental
civil
remote

through
landsat
satellites
thereby
realizing
many
successful
applications
recognizing
this
fact
i
directed
the
implementation
of
an
operational
civil
land
satellite
remote
sensing
system
with
the
operational
management
responsibility
in
commerces
national
oceanic
and

administration
in
addition
because
ocean
observations
from
space
can
meet
common
civil
and
military
data
requirements
a
national
oceanic
satellite
system
has
been
proposed
as
a
major
fy
new
start
space
science
exploration
the
goals
of
this
administrations
policy
in
space
science
have
been
to
continue
a
vigorous
program
of
planetary
exploration
to
understand
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
solar
system
utilize
the
space
telescope
and

to
usher
in
a
new
era
of

develop
a
better
understanding
of
the

and
its
interaction
with
the

to
both
the

have
worked
to

four
years

yet
despite
the
close

and
that
of

we
have
not
yet
seen

granting
full

to
the

it
is
my
hope
that
this
inequity
will
be
rectified
the

the
people
who
inhabit
washington
deserve
no
less
the
arts
the
arts
are
a
precious
national
resource
federal
support
for
the
arts
has
been
enhanced
during
my
administration
by
expanding
government
funding
and
services
to
arts
institutions
individual
artists
scholars
and
teachers
through
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
we
have
broadened
its
scope
and
reach
to
a
more
diverse
population
we
have
also
reactivated
the
federal
council
on
the
arts
and
humanities
it
is
my
hope
that
during
the
coming
years
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
will
continue
support
of
institutions
promoting
development
and
understanding
of
the
arts
encourage
business
participants
in
a
comprehensive
effort
to
achieve
a
truly
mixed
economy
of
support
for
the

explore
a
variety
of
mechanisms
to
nurture
the
creative
talent
of
our
citizens
and
build
audiences
for
their
work
support
strong
active
national

the

in
recently
reauthorizing
federal
appropriations
for
the
national
endowment
for
the
humanities
the
congress
has
once
again
reaffirmed
that
the
encouragement
and
support
of
national
progress
and
scholarship
in
the
humanities
while
primarily
a
matter
for
private
and
local
initiative
is
also
an
appropriate
matter
of
concern
to
the
federal
government
and
that
a
high
civilization
must
not
limit
its
efforts
to
science
and
technology
alone
but
must
give
full
value
and
support
to
the
other
great
branches
of
mans
scholarly
and
cultural
activity
in
order
to
achieve
a
better
understanding
of
the
past
a
better
analysis
of
the
present
and
a
better
view
of
the
future
i
believe
we
are
in
agreement
that
the
humanities
illuminate
the
values
underlying
important
personal
social
and
national
questions
raised
in
our
society
by
its
multiple
links
to
and
increasing
dependence
on
technology
and
by
the
diverse
heritage
of
our
many
regions
and
ethnic
groups
the
humanities
cast
light
on
the
broad
issue
of
the
role
in
a
society
of
men
and
women
of
imagination
and
energythose
individuals
who
through
their
own
example
define
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
in
so
doing
move
nations
our
governments
support
for
the
humanities
within
the
framework
laid
down
by
the
congress
is
a
recognition
of
their
essential
nourishment
of
the
life
of
the
mind
and
vital
enrichment
of
our
national
life
i
will
be
proposing
an
increase
in
funding
this
year
sufficient
to
enable
the
endowment
to
maintain
the
same
level
of
support
offered
our
citizens
in
fiscal
year
in
the
allocation
of
this
funding
special
emphasis
will
be
given
to
humanities
education
in
the
nations
schools
in
response
to
the
great
needs
that
have
arisen
in
this
area
scholarly
research
designed
to
increase
our
understanding
of
the
cultures
traditions
and
historical
forces
at
work
in
other
nations
and
in
our
own
drawing
attention
to
the
physical
disintegration
of
the
raw
material
of
our
cultural
heritagebooks
manuscripts
periodicals
and
other
documentsand
to
the
development
of
techniques
to
prevent
the
destruction
and
to
preserve
those
materials
and
the
dissemination
of
quality
programming
in
the
humanities
to
increasingly
large
american
audiences
through
the
use
of
radio
and
television
the
dominant
effort
in
the
endowments
expenditures
will
be
a
commitment
to
strengthen
and
promulgate
scholarly
excellence
and
achievement
in
work
in
the
humanities
in
our
schools
colleges
universities
libraries
museums
and
other
cultural
institutions
as
well
as
in
the
work
of
individual
scholars
or
collaborative
groups
engaged
in
advanced
research
in
the
humanities
in
making
its
grants
the
endowment
will
increase
its
emphasis
on
techniques
which
stimulate
support
for
the
humanities
from
nonfederal
sources
in
order
to
reinforce
our
tradition
of
private
philanthropy
in
this
field
and
to
insure
and
expand
the
financial
viability
of
our
cultural
institutions
and
life
insular
areas
i
have
been
firmly
committed
to
selfdetermination
for
puerto
rico
the
virgin
islands
guam
american
samoa
and
the
northern
mariana
islands
and
have
vigorously
supported
the
realization
of
whatever
political
status
aspirations
are
democratically
chosen
by
their
peoples
this
principle
was
the
keystone
of
the
comprehensive
territorial
policy
i
sent
the
congress
last
year
i
am
pleased
that
most
of
the
legislative
elements
of
that
policy
were
endorsed
by
the
th
congress
the
unique
cultures
fragile
economies
and
locations
of
our
caribbean
and
pacific
islands
are
distinct
assets
to
the
united
states
which
require
the
sensitive
application
of
policy
the
united
states
government
should
pursue
initiatives
begun
by
my
administration
and
the
congress
to
stimulate
insular
economic
development
enhance
treatment
under
federal
programs
eliminating
current
inequities
provide
vitally
needed
special
assistance
and
coordinate
and
rationalize
policies
these
measures
will
result
in
greater
selfsufficiency
and
balanced
growth
in
particular
i
hope
that
the
new
congress
will
support
funding
for
fiscal
management
comprehensive
planning
and
other
technical
assistance
for
the
territories
as
well
as
create
the
commission
i
have
proposed
to
review
the
applicability
of
all
federal
laws
to
the
insular
areas
and
make
recommendations
for
appropriate
modification
iv
removing
governmental
waste
and
inefficiency
one
of
my
major
commitments
has
been
to
restore
public
faith
in
our
federal
government
by
cutting
out
waste
and
inefficiency
in
the
past
four
years
we
have
made
dramatic
advances
toward
this
goal
many
of
them
previously
considered
impossible
to
achieve
where
government
rules
and
operations
were
unnecessary
they
have
been
eliminated
as
with
airline
rail
trucking
and
financial
deregulation
where
government
functions
are
needed
they
have
been
streamlined
through
such
landmark
measures
as
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
i
hope
that
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
will
keep
up
the
momentum
we
have
established
for
effective
and
responsible
change
in
this
area
of
crucial
public
concern
civil
service
reform
in
march
i
submitted
the
civil
service
reform
act
to
congress
i
called
it
the
centerpiece
of
my
efforts
to
reform
and
reorganize
the
government
with
bipartisan
support
from
congress
the
bill
passed
and
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
implementation
is
running
well
ahead
of
the
statutory
schedule
throughout
the
service
we
are
putting
into
place
the
means
to
assure
that
reward
and
retention
are
based
on
performance
and
not
simply
on
length
of
time
on
the
job
in
the
first
real
test
of
the
reform
act
percent
of
the
eligible
toplevel
managers
joined
the
senior
executive
service
choosing
to
relinquish
job
protections
for
the
challenge
and
potential
reward
of
this
new
corps
of
top
executives
though
the
act
does
not
require
several
of
its
key
elements
to
be
in
operation
for
another
year
some
federal
agencies
already
have
established
merit
pay
systems
for
gs
managers
and
most
agencies
are
well
on
their
way
to
establishing
new
performance
standards
for
all
their
employees
all
have
paid
out
or
are
now
in
the
process
of
paying
out
performance
bonuses
earned
by
outstanding
members
of
the
senior
executive
service
dismissals
have
increased
by
percent
and
dismissals
specifically
for
inadequate
job
performance
have
risen
percent
since
the
act
was
adopted
finally
we
have
established
a
fully
independent
merit
systems
protection
board
and
special
counsel
to
protect
the
rights
of
whistleblowers
and
other
federal
employees
faced
with
threats
to
their
rights
in
civil
service
reform
faces
critical
challenges
all
agencies
must
have
fully
functioning
performance
appraisal
systems
for
all
employees
and
merit
pay
systems
for
compensating
the
governments
gs
managers
performance
bonuses
for
members
of
the
senior
executive
service
will
surely
receive
scrutiny
if
this
attention
is
balanced
and
constructive
it
can
only
enhance
the
chances
for
ultimate
success
of
our
bipartisan
commitment
to
the
revolutionary
and
crucial
pay
for
performance
concept
regulatory
reform
during
the
past
four
years
we
have
made
tremendous
progress
in
regulatory
reform
we
have
discarded
old
economic
regulations
that
prevented
competition
and
raised
consumer
costs
and
we
have
imposed
strong
management
principles
on
the
regulatory
programs
the
country
needs
cutting
paperwork
and
other
wasteful
burdens
the
challenge
for
the
future
is
to
continue
the
progress
in
both
areas
without
crippling
vital
health
and
safety
programs
our
economic
deregulation
program
has
achieved
major
successes
in
five
areas
airlines
the
airline
deregulation
act
is
generating
healthy
competition
saving
billions
in
fares
and
making
the
airlines
more
efficient
the
act
provides
that
in
the
cab
itself
will
go
out
of
existence
trucking
the
trucking
deregulation
bill
opens
the
industry
to
competition
and
allows
truckers
wide
latitude
on
the
routes
they
drive
and
the
goods
they
haul
the
bill
also
phases
out
most
of
the
old
laws
immunity
for
setting
rates
the
congressional
budget
office
estimates
these
reforms
will
save
as
much
as
billion
per
year
and
cut
as
much
as
half
a
percentage
point
from
the
inflation
rate
railroads
overregulation
has
stifled
railroad
management
initiative
service
and
competitive
pricing
the
new
legislation
gives
the
railroads
the
freedom
they
need
to
rebuild
a
strong
efficient
railroad
industry
financial
institutions
with
the
help
of
the
congress
over
the
past
four
years
we
have
achieved
two
major
pieces
of
financial
reform
legislation
legislation
which
has
provided
the
basis
for
the
most
farreaching
changes
in
the
financial
services
industry
since
the
s
the
international
banking
act
of
was
designed
to
reduce
the
advantages
that
foreign
banks
operating
in
the
united
states
possessed
in
comparison
to
domestic
banks
the
depository
institutions
deregulation
and
monetary
control
act
adopted
last
march
provides
for
the
phased
elimination
of
a
variety
of
anticompetitive
barriers
to
financial
institutions
and
freedom
to
offer
services
to
and
attract
the
savings
of
consumers
especially
small
savers
recently
i
submitted
to
the
congress
my
administrations
recommendations
for
the
phased
liberalization
of
restrictions
on
geographic
expansion
by
commercial
banks
last
year
the
administration
and
financial
regulatory
agencies
proposed
legislation
to
permit
the
interstate
acquisition
of
failing
depository
institutions
in
view
of
the
difficult
outlook
for
some
depository
institutions
i
strongly
urge
the
congress
to
take
prompt
favorable
action
on
the
failing
bank
legislation
telecommunications
while
congress
did
not
pass
legislation
in
this
area
the
federal
communications
commission
has
taken
dramatic
action
to
open
all
aspects
of
communications
to
competition
and
to
eliminate
regulations
in
the
areas
where
competition
made
them
obsolete
the
public
is
benefitting
from
an
explosion
of
competition
and
new
services
while
these
initiatives
represent
dramatic
progress
in
economic
deregulation
continued
work
is
needed
i
urge
congress
to
act
on
communications
legislation
and
to
consider
other
proposed
deregulation
measures
such
as
legislation
on
the
bus
industry
in
addition
the
regulatory
commissions
must
maintain
their
commitment
to
competition
as
the
best
regulator
of
all
the
other
part
of
my
reform
program
covers
the
regulations
that
are
needed
to
protect
the
health
safety
and
welfare
of
our
citizens
for
these
regulations
my
administration
has
created
a
management
program
to
cut
costs
without
sacrificing
goals
under
my
executive
order
we
required
agencies
to
analyze
the
costs
of
their
major
new
rules
and
consider
alternative
approaches
such
as
performance
standards
and
voluntary
codes
that
may
make
rules
less
costly
and
more
flexible
we
created
the
regulatory
analysis
review
group
in
the
white
house
to
analyze
the
most
costly
proposed
new
rules
and
find
ways
to
improve
them
the
regulatory
council
was
established
to
provide
the
first
governmentwide
listing
of
upcoming
rules
and
eliminate
overlapping
and
conflicting
regulations
agencies
have
launched
sunset
programs
to
weed
out
outmoded
old
regulations
we
have
acted
to
encourage
public
participation
in
regulatory
decisionmaking
these
steps
have
already
saved
billions
of
dollars
in
regulatory
costs
and
slashed
thousands
of
outmoded
regulations
we
are
moving
steadily
toward
a
regulatory
system
that
provides
needed
protections
fairly
predictably
and
at
minimum
cost
i
urge
congress
to
continue
on
this
steady
path
and
resist
the
simplistic
solutions
that
have
been
proposed
as
alternatives
proposals
like
legislative
veto
and
increased
judicial
review
will
add
another
layer
to
the
regulatory
process
making
it
more
cumbersome
and
inefficient
the
right
approach
to
reform
is
to
improve
the
individual
statutes
where
they
need
change
and
to
ensure
that
the
regulatory
agencies
implement
those
statutes
sensibly
paperwork
reduction
the
federal
government
imposes
a
huge
paperwork
burden
on
business
local
government
and
the
private
sector
many
of
these
forms
are
needed
for
vital
government
functions
but
others
are
duplicative
overly
complex
or
obsolete
during
my
administration
we
cut
the
paperwork
burden
by
percent
and
we
created
procedures
to
continue
this
progress
the
new
paperwork
reduction
act
centralizes
in
omb
oversight
of
all
agencies
information
requirements
and
strengthens
ombs
authority
to
eliminate
needless
forms
the
paperwork
budget
process
which
i
established
by
executive
order
applies
the
discipline
of
the
budget
process
to
the
hours
of
reporting
time
imposed
on
the
public
forcing
agencies
to
scrutinize
all
their
forms
each
year
with
effective
implementation
these
steps
should
allow
further
substantial
paperwork
cuts
in
the
years
ahead
tightening
standards
for
governmental
efficiency
and
integrity
to
develop
a
foundation
to
carry
out
energy
policy
we
consolidated
scattered
energy
programs
and
launched
the
synthetic
fuels
corporation
to
give
education
the
priority
it
deserves
and
at
the
same
time
reduce
hhs
to
more
manageable
size
i
gave
education
a
seat
at
the
cabinet
table
to
create
a
stronger
system
for
attacking
waste
and
fraud
i
reorganized
audit
and
investigative
functions
by
putting
an
inspector
general
in
major
agencies
since
i
took
office
we
have
submitted
reorganization
initiatives
and
had
them
all
approved
by
congress
we
have
saved
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
through
the
adoption
of
businesslike
cash
management
principles
and
set
strict
standards
for
personal
financial
disclosure
and
conflict
of
interest
avoidance
by
high
federal
officials
to
streamline
the
structure
of
the
government
we
have
secured
approval
of
reorganization
initiatives
improving
the
efficiency
of
the
most
important
sectors
of
the
government
including
energy
education
and
civil
rights
enforcement
we
have
eliminated
more
than
advisory
committees
as
well
as
other
agencies
boards
and
commissions
which
were
obsolete
or
ineffective
independent
inspectors
general
have
been
appointed
in
major
agencies
to
attack
fraud
and
waste
more
than
a
billion
dollars
of
questionable
transactions
have
been
identified
through
their
audit
activities
the
adoption
of
businesslike
cash
management
and
debt
collection
initiatives
will
save
over
billion
by
streamlining
the
processing
of
receipts
by
controlling
disbursements
more
carefully
and
by
reducing
idle
cash
balances
finally
this
administration
has
set
strict
standards
for
personal
financial
disclosure
and
conflict
of
interest
avoidance
by
high
federal
officials
to
elevate
the
level
of
public
trust
in
the
government
v
protecting
basic
rights
and
liberties
i
am
extremely
proud
of
the
advances
we
have
made
in
ensuring
equality
and
protecting
the
basic
freedoms
of
all
americans
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
and
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
ofccp
have
been
reorganized
and
strengthened
and
a
permanent
civil

unit
has
been
established
in
omb
to
avoid
fragmented
inconsistent
and
duplicative
enforcement
of
civil

the
enactment

and
a

we
have
begun
to
establish
a
sound

ratification
of
the
equal

amendment
must
be
aggressively
pursued
only
one
year
remains
in
which
to
obtain
ratification
by
three
additional
states
the
congress
must
give
early
attention
to
a
number
of
important
bills
which
remain
these
bills
would
strengthen
the
laws
against

the
failure

remain

to
the
ratification
of

as
a
result
of
our
efforts
in
the
equal

deadline
for

was
extended
for
three
years
we
have
now
one
year
and
three

left
we
cannot
afford
any
delay
in
marshalling
our
resources
and
efforts
to
obtain
the
ratification
of
those
three
additional
states
although
the
congress
has
no
official
role
in
the

process
at
this
point
you
do
have
the
ability
to
affect
public
opinion
and
the
support
of
state
legislators
for
the
amendment
i
urge
members
from
states
which
have
not
yet
ratified
the
equal

amendment
to
use
their
influence
to
secure
ratification
i
will
continue

the
leaders
of
both
parties
have
pledged
to
make
the
enactment
of
fair
housing
legislation
a
top
priority
of
the
incoming
congress
the

is
pressing
and
a

must
be
the

of
resolution
criminal
code
the
federal
criminal
laws
are
often
archaic
frequently
contradictory
and
imprecise
and
clearly
in
need
of
revision
and
codification
the
new
administration
should
continue
the
work
which
has
been
begun
to
develop
a
federal
criminal
code
which
simplifies
and
clarifies
our
criminal
laws
while
maintaining
our
basic
civil
liberties
and
protections
privacy
as
our
public
and
private
institutions
collect
more
and
more
information
and
as
communications
and
computer
technologies
advance
we
must
act
to
protect
the
personal
privacy
of
our
citizens
in
the
past
four
years
we
acted
on
the
report
of
the
privacy
commission
and
established
a
national
privacy
policy
we
worked
with
congress
to
pass
legislation
restricting
wiretaps
and
law
enforcement
access
to
bank
records
and
to
reporters
files
we
reduced
the
number
of
personal
files
held
by
the
government
and
restricted
the
transfer
of
personal
information
among
federal
agencies
we
also
worked
with
the
organization
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
to
establish
international
guidelines
to
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
information
that
is
transferred
across

vi
protecting
and
developing
our
natural
resources
two
of
our
nations
most
precious
natural
resources
are
our
environment
and
our
vast
agricultural
capacity
from
the
beginning
of
my
administration
i
have
worked
with
the
congress
to
enhance
and
protect
as
well
as
develop
our
natural
resources
in
the
environmental
areas
i
have
been
especially
concerned
about
the
importance
of
balancing
the
need
for
resource
development
with
preserving
a
clean
environment
and
have
taken
numerous
actions
to
foster
this
goal
in
the
agricultural
area
i
have
taken
the
steps
needed
to
improve
farm
incomes
and
to
increase
our
agricultural
production
to
record
levels
that
progress
must
be
continued
in
the
s
environment
preserving
the
quality
of
our
environment
has
been
among
the
most
important
objectives
of
my
administration
and
of
the
congress
as
a
result
of
these
shared
commitments
and
the
dedicated
efforts
of
many
members
of
the
congress
and
my
administration
we
have
achieved
several
historic
accomplishments
protection
of
alaska
lands
passage
of
the
alaska
national
interest
lands
conservation
act
was
one
of
the
most
important
conservation
actions
of
this
century
at
stake
was
the
fate
of
millions
of
acres
of
beautiful
land
outstanding
and
unique
wildlife
populations
native
cultures
and
the
opportunity
to
ensure
that
future
generations
of
americans
would
be
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
these
nationally
significant
resources
as
a
result
of
the
leadership
commitment
and
persistence
of
my
administration
and
the
congressional
leadership
the
alaska
lands
bill
was
signed
into
law
last
december
the
act
adds
million
acres
of
new
parks
and
refuges
more
than
doubling
the
size
of
our
national
park
and
national
wildlife
refuge
systems
the
bill
triples
the
size
of
our
national
wilderness
system
increasing
its
size
by
million
acres
and
by
adding
freeflowing
river
segments
to
the
wild
and
scenic
river
system
the
bill
almost
doubles
the
river
mileage
in
that
system
the
alaska
lands
act
reaffirms
our
commitment
to
the
environment
and
strikes
a
balance
between
protecting
areas
of
great
beauty
and
allowing
development
of
alaskas
oil
gas
mineral
and
timber
resources
protection
of
natural
resources
in
addition
to
the
alaska
lands
act
over
the
past
four
years
we
have
been
able
to
expand
significantly
the
national
wilderness
and
parks
systems
in
the
congress
passed
the
historical
omnibus
parks
act
which
made
additions
to
the
national
park
system
the
act
also
established
the
first
two
national
trails
since
the
national
trails
system
act
was
passed
in
then
in
as
a
result
of
my
environmental
message
the
federal
land
management
agencies
have
established
almost
new
national
recreational
trails
with
the
completion
of
the
rare
ii
process
which
eliminated
the
uncertainty
surrounding
the
status
of
millions
of
acres
of
land
we
called
for
over
million
acres
of
new
wilderness
in
the
nations
national
forest
in
the
congress
established
about
million
acres
of
wilderness
in
the
lower
states
in
addition
the
administration
recommended
legislation
to
protect
lake
tahoe
and
through
an
executive
order
has
already
established
a
mechanism
to
help
ensure
the
lakes
protection
finally
in
the
administration
established
the
channel
islands
marine
sanctuary
administration
actions
over
the
past
four
years
stressed
the
importance
of
providing
federal
support
only
for
water
resource
projects
that
are
economically
and
environmentally
sound
this
policy
should
have
a
major
and
lasting
influence
on
the
federal
governments
role
in
water
resource
development
and
management
the
administrations
actions
to
recommend
to
the
congress
only
economically
and
environmentally
sound
water
resource
projects
for
funding
resulted
not
only
in
our
opposing
uneconomic
projects
but
also
in
in
the
first
administration
proposal
of
new
project
starts
in
years
one
of
the
most
significant
water
policy
actions
of
the
past
four
years
was
the
administrations
june
water
policy
reform
message
to
the
congress
this
message
established
a
new
national
water
resources
policy
with
the
following
objectives
to
give
priority
emphasis
to
water
conservation
to
consider
environmental
requirements
and
values
more
fully
and
along
with
economic
factors
in
the
planning
and
management
of
water
projects
and
programs
to
enhance
cooperation
between
state
and
federal
agencies
in
water
resources
planning
and
management
in
addition
the
executive
office
of
the
president
established
policy
decision
criteria
to
evaluate
the
proposed
federal
water
projects
the
water
resources
council
developed
and
adopted
a
new
set
of
principles
and
standards
for
water
projects
which
is
binding
on
all
federal
construction
agencies
and
improved
regulations
were
developed
to
implement
the
national
historic
preservation
act
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
coordination
act
as
a
result
water
resource
projects
must
be
determined
to
be
economically
sound
before
the
administration
will
recommend
authorization
or
appropriation
over
the
years
ahead
this
policy
will
help
to
reduce
wasteful
federal
spending
by
targeting
federal
funds
to
the
highest
priority
water
resource
projects
in
the
pursuit
of
this
policy
however
we
cannot
lose
projects
in
the
part
that
sound
water
resource
projects
play
in
providing
irrigation
power
and
flood
control
we
must
also
recognize
the
special
needs
of
particular
regions
of
the
country
in
evaluating
the
need
for
additional
projects
addressing
global
resource
and
environmental
problems
the
global
report
to
the
president
prepared
in
response
to
my
environment
message
is
the
first
of
its
kind
never
before
has
our
government
or
any
government
taken
such
a
comprehensive
longrange
look
at
the
interrelated
global
issues
of
resources
population
and
environment
the
reports
conclusions
are
important
they
point
to
a
rapid
increase
in
population
and
human
needs
through
the
year
while
at
the
same
time
a
decline
in
the
earths
capacity
to
meet
those
needs
unless
nations
of
the
world
act
decisively
to
alter
current
trends
the
united
states
has
contributed
actively
to
a
series
of
un
conferences
on
the
environment
population
and
resources
and
is
preparing
for
the
conference
on
new
and
renewable
sources
of
energy
following
my
environmental
message
the
administration
development
assistance
programs
have
added
emphasis
to
natural
resource
management
and
environmental
protection
my
environmental
message
called
attention
to
the
alarming
loss
of
world
forests
particularly
in
the
tropics
an
interagency
task
force
on
tropical
forests
has
developed
a
us
government
program
to
encourage
conservation
and
wise
management
of
tropical
forests
the
administration
is
encouraging
action
by
other
nations
and
world
organizations
to
the
same
purpose
the
united
states
is
a
world
leader
in
wildlife
conservation
and
the
assessment
of
environmental
effects
of
government
actions
the
january
executive
order
directing
us
government
agencies
to
consider
the
effects
of
their
major
actions
abroad
is
another
example
of
this
leadership
commitment
to
control
of
pollution
and
hazardous
chemicals
over
the
past
four
years
there
has
been
steady
progress
towards
cleaner
air
and
water
sustained
by
the
commitment
of
congress
and
the
administration
to
these
important
national
objectives
in
addition
the
administration
has
developed
several
new
pollution
compliance
approaches
such
as
alternative
and
innovative
waste
water
treatment
projects
the
bubble
concept
the
offset
policy
and
permit
consolidation
all
of
which
are
designed
to
reduce
regulatory
burdens
on
the
private
sector
one
of
the
most
pressing
problems
to
come
to
light
in
the
past
four
years
has
been
improper
hazardous
waste
disposal
the
administration
has
moved
on
three
fronts
first
we
proposed
the
oil
hazardous
substances
and
hazardous
waste
response
liability
and
compensation
act
the
superfund
bill
to
provide
comprehensive
authority
and
billion
in
funds
to
clean
up
abandoned
hazardous
waste
disposal
sites
in
november
the
congress
passed
a
superfund
bill
which
i
signed
into
law
second
the
administration
established
a
hazardous
waste
enforcement
strike
force
to
ensure
that
when
available
responsible
parties
are
required
to
clean
up
sites
posing
dangers
to
public
health
and
to
the
environment
to
date
lawsuits
have
been
brought
by
the
strike
force
third
regulations
implementing
subtitle
c
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
were
issued
the
regulations
establish
comprehensive
controls
for
hazardous
waste
and
together
with
vigorous
enforcement
will
help
to
ensure
that
love
canal
will
not
be
repeated
the
future
for
the
future
we
cannot
and
we
must
not
forget
that
we
are
charged
with
the
stewardship
of
an
irreplaceable
environment
and
natural
heritage
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
are
dependent
upon
our
maintaining
our
commitment
to
preserving
and
enhancing
the
quality
of
our
environment
it
is
my
hope
that
when
our
descendants
look
back
on
the
s
they
will
be
able
to
affirm
that
we
kept
our
commitment
to
the
restoration
of
environmental
quality
that
we
protected
the
public
health
from
the
continuing
dangers
of
toxic
chemicals
from
pollution
from
hazardous
and
radioactive
waste
and
that
we
made
our
communities
safer
healthier
and
better
places
to
live
that
we
preserved
americas
wilderness
areas
and
particularly
its
last
great
frontier
alaska
for
the
benefit
of
all
americans
in
perpetuity
that
we
put
this
nation
on
a
path
to
a
sustainable
energy
future
one
based
increasingly
on
renewable
resources
and
on
energy
conservation
that
we
moved
to
protect
americas
countryside
and
coastland
from
mismanagement
and
irresponsibility
that
we
redirected
the
management
of
the
nations
water
resources
toward
water
conservation
sound
development
and
environmental
protection
that
we
faced
squarely
such
worldwide
problems
as
the
destruction
of
forests
acid
rain
carbon
dioxide
buildup
and
nuclear
proliferation
and
that
we
protected
the
habitat
and
the
existence
of
our
own
species
on
this
earth
agriculture
the
farm
economy
the
farm
economy
is
sound
and
its
future
is
bright
agriculture
remains
a
major
bulwark
of
the
nations
economy
and
an
even
more
important
factor
in
the
world
food
system
the
demand
for
americas
agricultural
abundance
here
and
abroad
continues
to
grow
in
the
nearterm
the
strength
of
this
demand
is
expected
to
press
hard
against
supplies
resulting
in
continued
price
strength
the
health
and
vitality
of
currentday
agriculture
represents
a
significant
departure
from
the
situation
that
existed
when
i
came
to
office
four
years
ago
in
january
the
farm
economy
was
in
serious
trouble
farm
prices
and
farm
income
were
falling
rapidly
grain
prices
were
at
their
lowest
levels
in
years
and
steadily
falling
livestock
producers
in
their
fourth
straight
year
of
record
losses
were
liquidating
breeding
herds
at
an
unparalleled
rate
dairy
farmers
were
losing
money
on
every
hundredweight
of
milk
they
produced
sugar
prices
were
in
a
nosedive
through
a
combination
of
improvements
in
old
established
programs
and
the
adoption
of
new
approaches
where
innovation
and
change
were
needed
my
administration
turned
this
situation
around
commodity
prices
have
steadily
risen
farm
income
turned
upward
us
farm
exports
set
new
records
each
year
increasing
over
percent
for
the
four
year
period
livestock
producers
began
rebuilding
their
herds
dairy
farmers
began
to
earn
a
profit
again
recent
policy
initiatives
several
major
agricultural
policy
initiatives
have
been
undertaken
over
the
past
year
some
are
the
culmination
of
policy
proposals
made
earlier
in
this
administration
others
are
measures
taken
to
help
farmers
offset
the
impact
of
rapid
inflation
in
production
costs
in
combination
they
represent
a
significant
strengthening
of
our
nations
food
and
agricultural
policy
these
initiatives
include
food
security
reserve
the
congress
authorized
formation
of
a
million
ton
food
grain
reserve
for
use
in
international
food
assistance
this
reserve
makes
it
possible
for
the
united
states
to
stand
behind
its
food
aid
commitment
to
food
deficit
nations
even
during
periods
of
short
supplies
and
high
prices
this
corrects
a
serious
fault
in
our
past
food
assistance
policy
comprehensive
crop
insurance
the
congress
also
authorized
a
significant
new
crop
insurance
program
during
this
measure
provides
farmers
with
an
important
new
program
tool
for
sharing
the
economic
risks
that
are
inherent
to
agriculture
when
fully
operational
it
will
replace
a
hodgepodge
of
disaster
programs
that
suffered
from
numerous
shortcomings
special
loan
rates
another
legislative
measure
passed
late
in
the
nd
session
of
the
th
congress
authorizes
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
provide
higher
loan
rates
to
farmers
who
enter
their
grain
in
the
farmerowned
grain
reserve
this
additional
incentive
to
participate
will
further
strengthen
the
reserve
increased
loan
prices
in
july
i
administratively
raised
loan
prices
for
wheat
feedgrains
and
soybeans
to
help
offset
the
effects
of
a
serious
costprice
squeeze
at
the
same
time
the
release
and
call
prices
for
the
grain
reserve
were
adjusted
upward
higher
target
prices
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
of
raised
the
target
prices
for
crop
wheat
and
feed
grain
crops
this
change
corrected
for
shortcomings
in
the
adjustment
formula
contained
in
the
food
and
agriculture
act
of
future
agenda
the
food
and
agricultural
policies
adopted
by
this
administration
over
the
past
four
years
including
those
described
above
will
provide
a
firm
foundation
for
future
governmental
actions
in
this
field
expiration
of
the
food
and
agriculture
act
of
later
this
year
will
require
early
attention
by
the
congress
with
relatively
minor
changes
most
of
the
authorities
contained
in
the
act
should
be
extended
in
their
present
form
the
farmerowned
grain
reserve
has
proven
to
be
a
particularly
effective
means
of
stabilizing
grain
markets
and
should
be
preserved
in
essentially
its
present
form
beyond
this
it
will
be
important
for
the
congress
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
pricecost
developments
in
the
farm
sector
as
noted
above
some
of
the
actions
i
took
last
year
were
for
the
purpose
of
providing
relief
from
the
costprice
squeeze
facing
farmers
should
these
pressures
continue
further
actions
might
be
required
my
administration
has
devoted
particular
attention
to
the
issues
of
world
hunger
agricultural
land
use
and
the
future
structure
of
american
agriculture
i
encourage
the
congress
and
the
next
administration
to
review
the
results
of
these
landmark
enquiries
and
where
deemed
appropriate
to
act
on
their
recommendations
following
a
careful
review
of
the
situation
i
recently
extended
the
suspension
of
grain
sales
to
the
soviet
union
i
am
satisfied
that
this
action
has
served
its
purpose
effectively
and
fairly
however
as
long
as
this
suspension
must
remain
in
effect
it
will
be
important
for
the
next
administration
and
the
congress
to
take
whatever
actions
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
burden
does
not
fall
unfairly
on
our
nations
farmers
this
has
been
a
key
feature
of
my
administrations
policy
and
it
should
be
maintained
vii
foreign
policy
from
the
time
i
assumed
office
four
years
ago
this
month
i
have
stressed
the
need
for
this
country
to
assert
a
leading
role
in
a
world
undergoing
the
most
extensive
and
intensive
change
in
human
history
my
policies
have
been
directed
in
particular
at
three
areas
of
change
the
steady
growth
and
increased
projection
abroad
of
soviet
military
power
power
that
has
grown
faster
than
our
own
over
the
past
two
decades
the
overwhelming
dependence
of
western
nations
which
now
increasingly
includes
the
united
states
on
vital
oil
supplies
from
the
middle
east
the
pressures
of
change
in
many
nations
of
the
developing
world
in
iran
and
uncertainty
about
the
future
stability
of
many
developing
countries
as
a
result
of
those
fundamental
facts
we
face
some
of
the
most
serious
challenges
in
the
history
of
this
nation
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
is
a
threat
to
global
peace
to
eastwest
relations
and
to
regional
stable
flow
of
oil
as
the
unprecedented
relations
an
and
overwhelming
vote
in
the
general
assembly
demonstrated
countries
across
the
world
and
particularly
the
nonaligned
regard
the
soviet
invasion
as
a
threat
to
their
independence
and
security
turmoil
within
the
region
adjacent
to
the
persian
gulf
poses
risks
for
the
security
and
prosperity
of
every
oil
importing
nation
and
thus
for
the
entire
global
economy
the
continuing
holding
of
american
hostages
in
iran
is
both
an
affront
to
civilized
people
everywhere
and
a
serious
impediment
to
meeting
the
selfevident
threat
to
widelyshared
common
interests
including
those
of
iran
but
as
we
focus
our
most
urgent
efforts
on
pressing
problems
we
will
continue
to
pursue
the
benefits
that
only
change
can
bring
for
it
always
has
been
the
essence
of
america
that
we
want
to
move
on
we
understand
that
prosperity
progress
and
most
of
all
peace
cannot
be
had
by
standing
still
a
world
of
nations
striving
to
preserve
their
independence
and
of
peoples
aspiring
for
economic
development
and
political
freedom
is
not
a
world
hostile
to
the
ideals
and
interests
of
the
united
states
we
face
powerful
adversaries
but
we
have
strong
friends
and
dependable
allies
we
have
common
interests
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
worlds
nations
and
peoples
there
have
been
encouraging
developments
in
recent
years
as
well
as
matters
requiring
continued
vigilance
and
concern
our
alliances
with
the
worlds
most
advanced
and
democratic
states
from
western
europe
through
japan
are
stronger
than
ever
we
have
helped
to
bring
about
a
dramatic
improvement
in
relations
between
egypt
and
israel
and
an
historic
step
towards
a
comprehensive
arabisraeli
settlement
our
relations
with
china
are
growing
closer
providing
a
major
new
dimension
in
our
policy
in
asia
and
the
world
across
southern
africa
from
rhodesia
to
namibia
we
are
helping
with
the
peaceful
transition
to
majority
rule
in
a
context
of
respect
for
minority
as
well
as
majority
rights
we
have
worked
domestically
and
with
our
allies
to
respond
to
an
uncertain
energy
situation
by
conservation
and
diversification
of
energy
supplies
based
on
internationally
agreed
targets
we
have
unambiguously
demonstrated
our
commitment
to
defend
western
interests
in
southwest
asia
and
we
have
significantly
increased
our
ability
to
do
so
and
over
the
past
four
years
the
us
has
developed
an
energy
program
which
is
comprehensive
and
ambitious
new
institutions
have
been
established
such
as
the
synthetic
fuels
corporation
and
solar
bank
price
decontrol
for
oil
and
gas
is
proceeding
american
consumers
have
risen
to
the
challenge
and
we
have
experienced
real
improvements
in
consumption
patterns
the
central
challenge
for
us
today
is
to
our
steadfastedness
of
purpose
we
are
no
longer
tempted
by
isolationism
but
we
must
also
learn
to
deal
effectively
with
the
contradictions
of
the
world
the
need
to
cooperate
with
potential
adversaries
without
euphoria
without
undermining
our
determination
to
compete
with
such
adversaries
and
if
necessary
confront
the
threats
they
may
pose
to
our
security
we
face
a
broad
range
of
threats
and
opportunities
we
have
and
should
continue
to
pursue
a
broad
range
of
defense
diplomatic
and
economic
capabilities
and
objectives
i
see
six
basic
goals
for
america
in
the
world
over
the
s
first
we
will
continue
as
we
have
over
the
past
four
years
to
build
americas
military
strength
and
that
of
our
allies
and
friends
neither
the
soviet
union
nor
any
other
nation
will
have
reason
to
question
our
will
to
sustain
the
strongest
and
most
flexible
defense
forces
second
we
will
pursue
an
active
diplomacy
in
the
world
working
together
with
our
friends
and
allies
to
resolve
disputes
through
peaceful
means
and
to
make
any
aggressor
pay
a
heavy
price
third
we
will
strive
to
resolve
pressing
international
economic
problems
particularly
energy
and
inflation
and
continue
to
pursue
our
still
larger
objective
of
global
economic
growth
through
expanded
trade
and
development
assistance
and
through
the
preservation
of
an
open
multilateral
trading
system
fourth
we
will
continue
vigorously
to
support
the
process
of
building
democratic
institutions
and
improving
human
rights
protection
around
the
world
we
are
deeply
convinced
that
the
future
lies
not
with
dictatorship
but
democracy
fifth
we
remain
deeply
committed
to
the
process
of
mutual
and
verifiable
arms
control
particularly
to
the
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
and
further
development
of
nuclear
weapons
our
decision
to
defer
but
not
abandon
our
efforts
to
secure
ratification
of
the
salt
ii
treaty
reflects
our
firm
conviction
that
the
united
states
has
a
profound
national
security
interest
in
the
constraints
on
soviet
nuclear
forces
which
only
that
treaty
can
provide
sixth
we
must
continue
to
look
ahead
in
order
to
evaluate
and
respond
to
resource
environment
and
population
challenges
through
the
end
of
this
century
one
very
immediate
and
pressing
objective
that
is
uppermost
on
our
minds
and
those
of
the
american
people
is
the
release
of
our
hostages
in
iran
we
have
no
basic
quarrel
with
the
nation
the
revolution
or
the
people
of
iran
the
threat
to
them
comes
not
from
american
policy
but
from
soviet
actions
in
the
region
we
are
prepared
to
work
with
the
government
of
iran
to
develop
a
new
and
mutually
beneficial
relationship
but
that
will
not
be
possible
so
long
as
iran
continues
to
hold
americans
hostages
in
defiance
of
the
world
community
and
civilized
behavior
they
must
be
released
unharmed
we
have
thus
far
pursued
a
measured
program
of
peaceful
diplomatic
and
economic
steps
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
this
issue
without
resorting
to
other
remedies
available
to
us
under
international
law
this
reflects
the
deep
respect
of
our
nation
for
the
rule
of
law
and
for
the
safety
of
our
people
being
held
and
our
belief
that
a
great
power
bears
a
responsibility
to
use
its
strength
in
a
measured
and
judicious
manner
but
our
patience
is
not
unlimited
and
our
concern
for
the
wellbeing
of
our
fellow
citizens
grows
each
day
enhancing
national
security
american
military
strength
the
maintenance
of
national
security
is
my
first
concern
as
it
has
been
for
every
president
before
me
we
must
have
both
the
military
power
and
the
political
will
to
deter
our
adversaries
and
to
support
our
friends
and
allies
we
must
pay
whatever
price
is
required
to
remain
the
strongest
nation
in
the
world
that
price
has
increased
as
the
military
power
of
our
major
adversary
has
grown
and
its
readiness
to
use
that
power
been
made
all
too
evident
in
afghanistan
the
real
increases
in
defense
spending
therefore
probably
will
be
higher
than
previously
projected
protecting
our
security
may
require
a
larger
share
of
our
national
wealth
in
the
future
the
ussoviet
relationship
we
are
demonstrating
to
the
soviet
union
across
a
broad
front
that
it
will
pay
a
heavy
price
for
its
aggression
in
terms
of
our
relationship
throughout
the
last
decades
ussoviet
relations
have
been
a
mixture
of
cooperation
and
competition
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
and
the
imposition
of
a
puppet
government
have
highlighted
in
the
starkest
terms
the
darker
side
of
their
policies
going
well
beyond
competition
and
the
legitimate
pursuit
of
national
interest
and
violating
all
norms
of
international
law
and
practice
this
attempt
to
subjugate
an
independent
nonaligned
islamic
people
is
a
callous
violation
of
international
law
and
the
united
nations
charter
two
fundamentals
of
international
order
hence
it
is
also
a
dangerous
threat
to
world
peace
for
the
first
time
since
the
communization
of
eastern
europe
after
world
war
ii
the
soviets
have
sent
combat
forces
into
an
area
that
was
not
previously
under
their
control
into
a
nonaligned
and
sovereign
state
the
destruction
of
the
independence
of
the
afghanistan
government
and
the
occupation
by
the
soviet
union
have
altered
the
strategic
situation
in
that
part
of
the
world
in
a
very
ominous
fashion
it
has
significantly
shortened
the
striking
distance
to
the
indian
ocean
and
the
persian
gulf
for
the
soviet
union
it
has
also
eliminated
a
buffer
between
the
soviet
union
and
pakistan
and
presented
a
new
threat
to
iran
these
two
countries
are
now
far
more
vulnerable
to
soviet
political
intimidation
if
that
intimidation
were
to
prove
effective
the
soviet
union
could
control
an
area
of
vital
strategic
and
economic
significance
to
the
survival
of
western
europe
the
far
east
and
ultimately
the
united
states
it
has
now
been
over
a
year
since
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
dealt
a
major
blow
to
ussoviet
relations
and
the
entire
international
system
the
us
response
has
proven
to
be
serious
and
farreaching
it
has
been
increasingly
effective
imposing
real
and
sustained
costs
on
the
ussrs
economy
and
international
image
meanwhile
we
have
encouraged
and
supported
efforts
to
reach
a
political
settlement
in
afghanistan
which
would
lead
to
a
withdrawal
of
soviet
forces
from
that
country
and
meet
the
interests
of
all
concerned
it
is
soviet
intransigence
that
has
kept
those
efforts
from
bearing
fruit
meanwhile
an
overwhelming
november
resolution
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
on
afghanistan
has
again
made
clear
that
the
world
has
not
and
will
not
forget
afghanistan
and
our
response
continues
to
make
it
clear
that
soviet
use
of
force
in
pursuit
of
its
international
objectives
is
incompatible
with
the
notion
of
businessasusual
bilateral
communication
ussoviet
relations
remain
strained
by
the
continued
soviet
presence
in
afghanistan
by
growing
soviet
military
capabilities
and
by
the
soviets
apparent
willingness
to
use
those
capabilities
without
respect
for
the
most
basic
norms
of
international
behavior
but
the
ussoviet
relationship
remains
the
single
most
important
element
in
determining
whether
there
will
be
war
or
peace
and
so
despite
serious
strains
in
our
relations
we
have
maintained
a
dialogue
with
the
soviet
union
over
the
past
year
through
this
dialogue
we
have
ensured
against
bilateral
misunderstandings
and
miscalculations
which
might
escalate
out
of
control
and
have
managed
to
avoid
the
injection
of
superpower
rivalries
into
areas
of
tension
like
the
iraniraq
conflict
poland
now
as
was
the
case
a
year
ago
the
prospect
of
soviet
use
of
force
threatens
the
international
order
the
soviet
union
has
completed
preparations
for
a
possible
military
intervention
against
poland
although
the
situation
in
poland
has
shown
signs
of
stabilizing
recently
soviet
forces
remain
in
a
high
state
of
readiness
and
they
could
move
into
poland
on
short
notice
we
continue
to
believe
that
the
polish
people
should
be
allowed
to
work
out
their
internal
problems
themselves
without
outside
interference
and
we
have
made
clear
to
the
soviet
leadership
that
any
intervention
in
poland
would
have
severe
and
prolonged
consequences
for
eastwest
detente
and
ussoviet
relations
in
particular
defense
budget
for
many
years
the
soviets
have
steadily
increased
their
real
defense
spending
expanded
their
strategic
forces
strengthened
their
forces
in
europe
and
asia
and
enhanced
their
capability
for
projecting
military
force
around
the
world
directly
or
through
the
use
of
proxies
afghanistan
dramatizes
the
vastly
increased
military
power
of
the
soviet
union
the
soviet
union
has
built
a
war
machine
far
beyond
any
reasonable
requirements
for
their
own
defense
and
security
in
contrast
our
own
defense
spending
declined
in
real
terms
every
year
from
through
we
have
reversed
this
decline
in
our
own
effort
every
year
since
there
has
been
a
real
increase
in
our
defense
spending
and
our
lead
has
encouraged
increases
by
our
allies
with
the
support
of
the
congress
we
must
and
will
make
an
even
greater
effort
in
the
years
ahead
the
fiscal
year
budget
would
increase
funding
authority
for
defense
to
more
than
billion
this
amount
together
with
a
supplemental
request
for
fy
of
about
billion
will
more
than
meet
my
administrations
pledge
for
a
sustained
growth
of
percent
in
real
expenditures
and
provides
for
percent
in
program
growth
in
fy
and
beyond
the
trends
we
mean
to
correct
cannot
be
remedied
overnight
we
must
be
willing
to
see
this
program
through
to
ensure
that
we
do
so
i
am
setting
a
growth
rate
for
defense
that
we
can
sustain
over
the
long
haul
the
defense
program
i
have
proposed
for
the
next
five
years
will
require
some
sacrifice
but
sacrifice
we
can
well
afford
the
defense
program
emphasizes
four
areas
it
ensures
that
our
strategic
nuclear
forces
will
be
equivalent
to
those
of
the
soviet
union
and
that
deterrence
against
nuclear
war
will
be
maintained
it
upgrades
our
forces
so
that
the
military
balance
between
nato
and
the
warsaw
pact
will
continue
to
deter
the
outbreak
of
war
conventional
or
nuclear
in
europe
it
provides
us
the
ability
to
come
quickly
to
the
aid
of
friends
and
allies
around
the
globe
and
it
ensures
that
our
navy
will
continue
to
be
the
most
powerful
on
the
seas
strategic
forces
we
are
strengthening
each
of
the
three
legs
of
our
strategic
forces
the
cruise
missile
production
which
will
begin
next
year
will
modernize
our
strategic
air
deterrent
b
capabilities
will
also
be
improved
these
steps
will
maintain
and
enhance
the
b
fleet
by
improving
its
ability
to
deliver
weapons
against
increasingly
heavily
defended
targets
we
are
also
modernizing
our
strategic
submarine
force
four
more
poseidon
submarines
backfitted
with
new
mile
trident
i
missiles
began
deployments
in
nine
trident
submarines
have
been
authorized
through
and
we
propose
one
more
each
year
the
new
mx
missile
program
to
enhance
our
landbased
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
force
continues
to
make
progress
technical
refinements
in
the
basing
design
over
the
last
year
will
result
in
operational
benefits
lower
costs
and
reduced
environmental
impact
the
mx
program
continues
to
be
an
essential
ingredient
in
our
strategic
posture
providing
survivability
endurance
secure
command
and
control
and
the
capability
to
threaten
targets
the
soviets
hold
dear
our
new
systems
will
enable
us
strategic
forces
to
maintain
equivalence
in
the
face
of
the
mounting
soviet
challenge
we
would
however
need
an
even
greater
investment
in
strategic
systems
to
meet
the
likely
soviet
buildup
without
salt
strategic
doctrine
this
administrations
systematic
contributions
to
the
necessary
evolution
of
strategic
doctrine
began
in
when
i
commissioned
a
comprehensive
net
assessment
from
that
base
a
number
of
thorough
investigations
of
specific
topics
continued
i
should
emphasize
that
the
need
for
an
evolutionary
doctrine
is
driven
not
by
any
change
in
our
basic
objective
which
remains
peace
and
freedom
for
all
mankind
rather
the
need
for
change
is
driven
by
the
inexorable
buildup
of
soviet
military
power
and
the
increasing
propensity
of
soviet
leaders
to
use
this
power
in
coercion
and
outright
aggression
to
impose
their
will
on
others
i
have
codified
our
evolving
strategic
doctrine
in
a
number
of
interrelated
and
mutually
supporting
presidential
directives
their
overarching
theme
is
to
provide
a
doctrinal
basis
and
the
specific
program
to
implement
it
that
tells
the
world
that
no
potential
adversary
of
the
united
states
could
ever
conclude
that
the
fruits
of
his
aggression
would
be
significant
or
worth
the
enormous
costs
of
our
retaliation
the
presidential
directives
include
pd
an
overview
of
our
strategic
objectives
pd
basic
space
policy
pd
civil
defense
pd
survivability
and
endurance
for
telecommunications
pd
mobilization
planning
pd
continuity
of
government
pd
countervailing
strategy
for
general
war
these
policies
have
been
devised
to
deter
first
and
foremost
soviet
aggression
as
such
they
confront
not
only
soviet
military
forces
but
also
soviet
military
doctrine
by
definition
deterrence
requires
that
we
shape
soviet
assessments
about
the
risks
of
war
assessments
they
will
make
using
their
doctrine
not
ours
but
at
the
same
time
we
in
no
way
seek
to
emulate
their
doctrine
in
particular
nothing
in
our
policy
contemplates
that
nuclear
warfare
could
ever
be
a
deliberate
instrument
for
achieving
our
own
goals
of
peace
and
freedom
moreover
our
policies
are
carefully
devised
to
provide
the
greatest
possible
incentives
and
opportunities
for
future
progress
in
arms
control
finally
our
doctrinal
evolution
has
been
undertaken
with
appropriate
consultation
with
our
nato
allies
and
others
we
are
fully
consistent
with
natos
strategy
of
flexible
response
forces
for
nato
we
are
greatly
accelerating
our
ability
to
reinforce
western
europe
with
massive
ground
and
air
forces
in
a
crisis
we
are
undertaking
a
major
modernization
program
for
the
armys
weapons
and
equipment
adding
armor
firepower
and
tactical
mobility
we
are
prepositioning
more
heavy
equipment
in
europe
to
help
us
cope
with
attacks
with
little
warning
and
greatly
strengthening
our
airlift
and
sealift
capabilities
we
are
also
improving
our
tactical
air
forces
buying
about
new
fighter
and
attack
aircraft
over
the
next
five
years
and
increasing
the

by

we
are
working
closely
with
our
european

to
secure
the
host

support
necessary
to
enable
us
to
deploy
more
quickly

security
assistance
as
we
move
to
enhance
us
defense
capabilities
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
need
to
assist
others
in
maintaining
their
own
security
and
independence
events
since
world
war
ii
most
recently
in
southwest
asia
have
amply
demonstrated
that
us
security
cannot
exist
in
a
vacuum
and
that
our
own
prospects
for
peace
are
closely
tied
to
those
of
our
friends
the
security
assistance
programs
which
i
am
proposing
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
thus
directly
promote
vital
us
foreign
policy
and
national
security
aims
and
are
integral
parts
of
our
efforts
to
improve
and
upgrade
our
own
military
forces
more
specifically
these
programs
which
are
part
of
our
overall
foreign
aid
request
promote
us
security
in
two
principal
ways
first
they
assist
friendly
and
allied
nations
to
develop
the
capability
to
defend
themselves
and
maintain
their
own
independence
an
example
during
this
past
year
was
the
timely
support
provided
thailand
to
help
bolster
that
countrys
defenses
against
the
large
numbers
of
sovietbacked
vietnamese
troops
ranged
along
its
eastern
frontier
in
addition
over
the
years
these
programs
have
been
important
to
the
continued
independence
of
other
friends
and
allies
such
as
israel
greece
turkey
and
korea
second
security
assistance
constitutes
an
essential
element
in
the
broad
cooperative
relationships
we
have
established
with
many
nations
which
permit
either
us
bases
on
their
territory
or
access
by
us
forces
to
their
facilities
these
programs
have
been
particularly
important
with
regard
to
the
recentlyconcluded
access
agreements
with
various
countries
in
the
persian
gulf
and
indian
ocean
regions
and
have
been
crucial
to
the
protection
of
our
interests
throughout
southwest
asia
rapid
deployment
forces
we
are
systematically
enhancing
our
ability
to
respond
rapidly
to
nonnato
contingencies
wherever
required
by
our
commitments
or
when
our
vital
interests
are
threatened
the
rapid
deployment
forces
we
are
assembling
will
be
extraordinarily
flexible
they
could
range
in
size
from
a
few
ships
or
air
squadrons
to
formations
as
large
as
men
together
with
their
support
our
forces
will
be
prepared
for
rapid
deployment
to
any
region
of
strategic
significance
among
the
specific
initiatives
we
are
taking
to
help
us
respond
to
crises
outside
of
europe
are
the
development
of
a
new
fleet
of
large
cargo
aircraft
with
intercontinental
range
the
design
and
procurement
of
a
force
of
maritime
prepositioning
ships
that
will
carry
heavy
equipment
and
supplies
for
three
marine
corps
brigades
the
procurement
of
fast
sealift
ships
to
move
large
quantities
of
men
and
material
quickly
from
the
us
to
overseas
areas
of
deployment
increasing
training
and
exercise
activities
to
ensure
that
our
forces
will
be
well
prepared
to
deploy
and
operate
in
distant
areas
in
addition
our
european
allies
have
agreed
on
the
importance
of
providing
support
to
us
deployments
to
southwest
asia
naval
forces
seapower
is
indispensable
to
our
global
position
in
peace
and
also
in
war
our
shipbuilding
program
will
sustain
a
ship
navy
in
the
s
and
we
will
continue
to
build
the
most
capable
ships
afloat
the
program
i
have
proposed
will
assure
the
ability
of
our
navy
to
operate
in
high
threat
areas
to
maintain
control
of
the
seas
and
protect
vital
lines
of
communication
both
military
and
economic
and
to
provide
the
strong
maritime
component
of
our
rapid
deployment
forces
this
is
essential
for
operations
in
remote
areas
of
the
world
where
we
cannot
predict
far
in
advance
the
precise
location
of
trouble
or
preposition
equipment
on
land
military
personnel
no
matter
how
capable
or
advanced
our
weapons
systems
our
military
security
depends
on
the
abilities
the
training
and
the
dedication
of
the
people
who
serve
in
our
armed
forces
i
am
determined
to
recruit
and
to
retain
under
any
foreseeable
circumstances
an
ample
level
of
such
skilled
and
experienced
military
personnel
this
administration
has
supported
for
fy
the
largest
peacetime
increase
ever
in
military
pay
and
allowances
we
have
enhanced
our
readiness
and
combat
endurance
by
improving
the
reserve
components
all
reservists
are
assigned
to
units
structured
to
complement
and
provide
needed
depth
to
our
active
forces
some
reserve
personnel
have
also
now
been
equipped
with
new

mobilization
planning
we
have
completed
our
first
phase
of
mobilization

the
first
such
presidentiallydirected
effort
since
world
war
ii
the
governmentwide
exercise
of
our
mobilization
plans
at
the
end
of
showed
first
that
planning
pays
off
and
second
that
much
more
needs
to
be
done
our
intelligence
posture
our
national
interests
are
critically
dependent
on
a
strong
and
effective
intelligence
capability
we
will
maintain
and
strengthen
the
intelligence
capabilities
needed
to
assure
our
national
security
maintenance
of
and
continued
improvements
in
our
multifaceted
intelligence
effort
are
essential
if
we
are
to
cope
successfully
with
the
turbulence
and
uncertainties
of
todays
world
the
intelligence
budget
i
have
submitted
to
the
congress
responds
to
our
needs
in
a
responsible
way
providing
for
significant
growth
over
the
fiscal
year
budget
this
growth
will
enable
us
to
develop
new
technical
means
of
intelligence
collection
while
also
assuring
that
the
more
traditional
methods
of
intelligence
work
are
also
given
proper
stress
we
must
continue
to
integrate
both
modes
of
collection
in
our
analyses
regional
policies
every
president
for
over
three
decades
has
recognized
that
americas
interests
are
global
and
that
we
must
pursue
a
global
foreign
policy
two
world
wars
have
made
clear
our
stake
in
western
europe
and
the
north
atlantic
area
we
are
also
inextricably
linked
with
the
far
east
politically
economically
and
militarily
in
both
of
these
the
united
states
has
a
permanent
presence
and
security
commitments
which
would
be
automatically
triggered
we
have
become
increasingly
conscious
of
our
growing
interests
in
a
third
area
the
middle
east
and
the
persian
gulf
area
we
have
vital
stakes
in
other
major
regions
of
the
world
as
well
we
have
long
recognized
that
in
an
era
of
interdependence
our
own
security
and
prosperity
depend
upon
a
larger
common
effort
with
friends
and
allies
throughout
the
world
the
atlantic
alliance
in
recognition
of
the
threat
which
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
posed
to
western
interests
in
both
europe
and
southwest
asia
nato
foreign
and
defense
ministers
have
expressed
full
support
for
us
efforts
to
develop
a
capability
to
respond
to
a
contingency
in
southwest
asia
and
have
approved
an
extensive
program
to
help
fill
the
gap
which
could
be
created
by
the
diversion
of
us
forces
to
that
region
the
us
has
not
been
alone
in
seeking
to
maintain
stability
in
the
southwest
asia
area
and
insure
access
to
the
needed
resources
there
the
european
nations
with
the
capability
to
do
so
are
improving
their
own
forces
in
the
region
and
providing
greater
economic
and
political
support
to
the
residents
of
the
area
in
the
face
of
the
potential
danger
posed
by
the
iraniraq
conflict
we
have
developed
coordination
among
the
western
forces
in
the
area
of
the
persian
gulf
in
order
to
be
able
to
safeguard
passage
in
that
essential
waterway
concerning
developments
in
and
around
poland
the
allies
have
achieved
the
highest
level
of
cohesion
and
unity
of
purpose
in
making
clear
the
effects
on
future
eastwest
relations
of
a
precipitous
soviet
act
there
the
alliance
has
continued
to
build
on
the
progress
of
the
past
three
years
in
improving
its
conventional
forces
through
the
longterm
defense
program
though
economic
conditions
throughout
europe
today
are
making
its
achievement
difficult
the
yearly
real
increase
of
percent
in
defense
spending
remains
a
goal
actively
sought
by
the
alliance
the
nato
alliance
also
has
moved
forward
during
the
past
year
with
the
implementation
of
its
historic
december
decision
to
modernize
its
theater
nuclear
force
capabilities
through
deployment
of
improved
pershing
ballistic
missiles
and
groundlaunched
cruise
missiles
in
europe
our
allies
continue
to
cooperate
actively
with
us
in
this
important
joint
endeavor
whose
purpose
is
to
demonstrate
convincingly
to
the
soviet
union
the
potential
costs
of
a
nuclear
conflict
in
europe
at
the
same
time
we
offered
convincing
evidence
of
our
commitment
to
arms
control
in
europe
by
initiating
preliminary
consultations
with
the
soviet
union
in
geneva
on
the
subject
of
negotiated
limits
on
longrange
theater
nuclear
forces
also
during
we
initiated
and
carried
out
a
withdrawal
from
our
nuclear
weapons
stockpile
in
europe
of
nuclear
warheads
this
successful
drawdown
in
our
nuclear
stockpile
was
a
further
tangible
demonstration
of
our
commitment
to
the
updating
of
our
existing
theater
nuclear
forces
in
europe
in
the
nato
area
we
continued
to
work
closely
with
other
countries
in
providing
resources
to
help
turkey
regain
economic
health
we
regretted
that
massive
political
and
internal
security
problems
led
the
turkish
military
to
take
over
the
government
on
september
the
new
turkish
authorities
are
making
some
progress
in
resolving
those
problems
and
they
have
pledged
an
early
return
to
civilian
government
the
tradition
of
the
turkish
military
gives
us
cause
to
take
that
pledge
seriously
we
welcomed
the
reestablishment
of
greeces
links
to
the
integrated
military
command
structure
of
the
atlantic

move
which
we
had
strongly
encouragedas
a
major
step
toward
strengthening
natos
vital
southern
flank
at
a
time
of
international
crisis
and
tension
in
adjacent
areas
greek
reintegration
exemplifies
the
importance
which
the
allies
place
on
cooperating
in
the
common
defense
and
shows
that
the
allies
can
make
the
difficult
decisions
necessary
to
insure
their
continued
security
we
also
welcomed
the
resumption
of
the
intercommunal
talks
on

is
a

in

are
as
important
to

our
trade
with

is
as
great
as

have
regained
a

have
established

between

exemplified
by
a
series
of
highlevel

and
by
regular

at

peacefully
can

after

on

grounds

in
support
of

have
worked
vigorously
with

to
arrange

for
the

which
threatened
to
overwhelm

are
in
the

enter

based
on
stable
and
productive
us
relations
with
the

we
have
established

level
of

involvement
in
the

appropriate
to
our
own
interests
and
to
the
interests
of

there
the
middle

and
southwest
asia
the
continuing
soviet
occupation
of
afghanistan
and
the
dislocations
caused
by
the
iraqiran
war
serve
as
constant
reminders
of
the
critical
importance
for
us
and
our
allies
of
a
third
strategic
zone
stretching
across
the
middle
east
the
persian
gulf
and
much
of
the
indian
subcontinent
this
southwest
asian
region
has
served
as
a
key
strategic
and
commercial
link
between
east
and
west
over
the
centuries
today
it
produces
twothirds
of
the
worlds
oil
exports
providing
most
of
the

it
has
experienced
almost
continuous
conflict
between

internal
instabilities
in
many
countries
and
regional
rivalries
combined
with
very
rapid
economic
and
social
change
and
now
the

remains
in
occupation
of
one
of
these

ignoring
world
opinion
which
has
called
on

get
out
we
have
taken
several
measures
to
meet

our

already
been
achieved
in

to
buttress
that
accomplishment
with
further

toward
a
comprehensive

remain
a
central
goal
of
our
foreign
policy
pursuant
to
their
peace
treaty
egypt
and
israel
have
made
steady
progress
in
the
normalization
of
their
relations
in
a
variety
of
fields
bringing
the
benefits
of
peace
directly
to
their
people
the
new
relationship
between
egypt
and
israel
stands
as
an
example
of
peaceful
cooperation
in
an
increasingly
fragmented
and
turbulent
region
both
president

minister
begin
remain
committed
to
the
current
negotiations
to
provide
full
autonomy
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
west
bank
and
gaza
these
negotiations
have
been
complex
and
difficult
but
they
have
already
made
significant
progress
and
it
is
vital
that
the
two
sides
with
our
assistance
see
the
process
through
to
a
successful
conclusion
we
also
recognize
the
need
to
broaden
the
peace
process
to
include
other
parties
to
the
conflict
and
believe
that
a
successful
autonomy
agreement
is
an
essential
first
step
toward
this
objective
we
have
also
taken
a
number
of
steps
to
strengthen
our
bilateral
relations
with
both
israel
and
egypt
we
share
important
strategic
interests
with
both
of
these
countries
we
remain
committed
to
israels
security
and
are
prepared
to
take
concrete
steps
to
support
israel
whenever
that
security
is
threatened
persian
gulf
the
persian
gulf
has
been
a
vital
crossroads
for
trade
between
europe
and
asia
at
many
key
moments
in
history
it
has
become
essential
in
recent
years
for
its
supply
of
oil
to
the
united
states
our
allies
and
our
friends
we
have
taken
effective
measures
to
control
our
own
consumption
of
imported
fuel
working
in
cooperation
with
the
other
key
industrial
nations
of
the
world
however
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
healthy
growth
of
our
american
and
world
economies
will
depend
for
many
years
on
continued
safe
access
to
the
persian
gulfs
oil
production
the
denial
of
these
oil
supplies
would
threaten
not
only
our
own
but
world
security
the
potent
new
threat
from
an
advancing
soviet
union
against
the
background
of
regional
instability
of
which
it
can
take
advantage
requires
that
we
reinforce
our
ability
to
defend
our
regional
friends
and
to
protect
the
flow
of
oil
we
are
continuing
to
build
on
the
strong
political
economic
social
and
humanitarian
ties
which
bind
this
government
and
the
american
people
to
friendly
governments
and
peoples
of
the
persian
gulf
we
have
also
embarked
on
a
course
to
reinforce
the
trust
and
confidence
our
regional
friends
have
in
our
ability
to
come
to
their
assistance
rapidly
with
american
military
force
if
needed
we
have
increased
our
naval
presence
in
the
indian
ocean
we
have
created
a
rapid
deployment
force
which
can
move
quickly
to
the
gulfor
indeed
any
other
area
of
the
world
where
outside
aggression
threatens
we
have
concluded
several
agreements
with
countries
which
are
prepared
to
let
us
use
their
airports
and
naval
facilities
in
an
emergency
we
have
met
requests
for
reasonable
amounts
of
american
weaponry
from
regional
countries
which
are
anxious
to
defend
themselves
and
we
are
discussing
with
a
number
of
our
area
friends
further
ways
we
can
help
to
improve
their
security
and
ours
both
for
the
short
and
the
longer
term
south
asia
we
seek
a
south
asia
comprising
sovereign
and
stable
states
free
of
outside
interference
which
can
strengthen
their
political
institutions
according
to
their
own
national
genius
and
can
develop
their
economies
for
the
betterment
of
their
people
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
has
posed
a
new
challenge
to
this
region
and
particularly
to
neighboring
pakistan
we
are
engaged
in
a
continuing
dialogue
with
the
pakistan
government
concerning
its
development
and
security
requirements
and
the
economic
burden
imposed
by
afghan
refugees
who
have
fled
to
pakistan
we
are
participating
with
other
aid
consortium
members
in
debt
rescheduling
and
will
continue
to
cooperate
through
the
unhcr
in
providing
refugee
assistance
we
remain
committed
to
pakistans
territorial
integrity
and
independence
developments
in
the
broad
southsouthwest
asian
region
have
also
lent
a
new
importance
to
our
relations
with
india
the
largest
and
strongest
power
in
the
area
we
share
indias
interest
in
a
more
constructive
relationship
indian
policies
and
perceptions
at
times
differ
from
our
own
and
we
have
established
a
candid
dialogue
with
this
sister
democracy
which
seeks
to
avoid
the
misunderstandings
which
have
sometimes
complicated
our
ties
we
attach
major
importance
to
strong
economic
assistance
programs
to
the
countries
in
the
area
which
include
a
majority
of
the
poor
of
the
noncommunist
world
we
believe
that
these
programs
will
help
achieve
stability
in
the
area
an
objective
we
share
with
the
countries
in
the
region
great
progress
has
been
achieved
by
these
countries
in
increasing
food
production
international
cooperation
in
harnessing
the
great
river
resources
of
south
asia
would
contribute
further
to
this
goal
and
help
to
increase
energy
production
we
continue
to
give
high
priority
to
our
nonproliferation
goals
in
the
area
in
the
context
of
our
broad
global
and
regional
priorities
the
decision
to
continue
supply
of
nuclear
fuel
to
the
indian
tarapur
reactors
was
sensitive
to
this
effort
africa
the
united
states
has
achieved
a
new
level
of
trust
and
cooperation
with
africa
our
efforts
together
with
our
allies
to
achieve
peace
in
southern
africa
our
increased
efforts
to
help
the
poorest
countries
in
africa
to
combat
poverty
and
our
expanded
efforts
to
promote
trade
and
investment
have
led
to
growing
respect
for
the
us
and
to
cooperation
in
areas
of
vital
interest
to
the
united
states
africa
is
a
continent
of
poor
nations
for
the
most
part
it
also
contains
many
of
the
mineral
resources
vital
for
our
economy
we
have
worked
with
africa
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
cooperation
to
help
the
african
nations
solve
their
problems
of
poverty
and
to
develop
stronger
ties
between
our
private
sector
and
african
economies
our
assistance
to
africa
has
more
than
doubled
in
the
last
four
years
equally
important
we
set
in
motion
new
mechanisms
for
private
investment
and
trade
nigeria
is
the
largest
country
in
black
africa
and
the
second
largest
oil
supplier
to
the
united
states
during
this
administration
we
have
greatly
expanded
and
improved
our
relationship
with
nigeria
and
other
west
african
states
whose
aspirations
for
a
constitutional
democratic
order
we
share
and
support
this
interest
was
manifested
both
symbolically
and
practically
by
the
visit
of
vice
president
mondale
to
west
africa
in
july
and
the
successful
visit
to
washington
of
the
president
of
nigeria
in
october
during
vice
president
mondales
visit
a
joint
agricultural
consultative
committee
was
established
with
the
us
represented
entirely
by
the
private
sector
this
could
herald
a
new
role
for
the
american
private
sector
in
helping
solve
the
worlds
serious
food
shortages
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
our
relations
with
nigeria
are
at
an
alltime
high
providing
the
foundation
for
an
even
stronger
relationship
in
the
years
ahead
another
tenet
of
this
administrations
approach
to
african
problems
has
been
encouragement
and
support
for
regional
solutions
to
africas
problems
we
have
supported
initiatives
by
the
organization
of
african
unity
to
solve
the
protracted
conflict
in
the
western
sahara
chad
and
the
horn
in
chad
the
world
is
watching
with
dismay
as
a
country
torn
by
a
devastating
civil
war
has
become
a
fertile
field
for
libyas
exploitation
thus
demonstrating
that
threats
to
peace
can
come
from
forces
within
as
well
as
without
africa
in
southern
africa
the
united
states
continues
to
pursue
a
policy
of
encouraging
peaceful
development
toward
majority
rule
in
southern
rhodesia
became
independent
as
zimbabwe
a
multiracial
nation
under
a
system
of
majority
rule
zimbabwean
independence
last
april
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
struggle
within
the
country
and
diplomatic
efforts
involving
great
britain
african
states
neighboring
zimbabwe
and
the
united
states
the
focus
of
our
efforts
in
pursuit
of
majority
rule
in
southern
africa
has
now
turned
to
namibia
negotiations
are
proceeding
among
concerned
parties
under
the
leadership
of
un
secretary
general
waldheim
this
should
lead
to
implementation
of
the
un
plan
for
selfdetermination
and
independence
for
namibia
during
if
these
negotiations
are
successfully
concluded
sixtyfive
years
of
uncertainty
over
the
status
of
the
territory
including
a
sevenyearlong
war
will
be
ended
in
response
to
our
active
concern
with
issues
of
importance
to
africans
african
states
have
cooperated
with
us
on
issues
of
importance
to
our
national
interests
african
states
voted
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
un
resolution
calling
for
release
of
the
hostages
and
for
the
un
resolution
condemning
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
two
countries
of
africa
have
signed
access
agreements
with
the
us
allowing
us
use
of
naval
and
air
facilities
in
the
indian
ocean
africans
have
become
increasingly
vocal
on
human
rights
african
leaders
have
spoken
out
on
the
issue
of
political
prisoners
and
the
oau
is
drafting
its
own
charter
on
human
rights
three
countries
in
africa
nigeria
ghana
and
ugandahave
returned
to
civilian
rule
during
the
past
year
us
cooperation
with
africa
on
all
these
matters
represents
a
strong
base
on
which
we
can
build
in
future
years
liberia
is
a
country
of
longstanding
ties
with
the
us
and
the
site
of
considerable
us
investment
and
facilities
this
past
april
a
coup
replaced
the
government
and
a
period
of
political
and
economic
uncertainty
ensued
the
us
acted
swiftly
to
meet
this
situation
we
together
with
african
leaders
urged
the
release
of
political
prisoners
and
many
have
been
released
we
provided
emergency
economic
assistance
to
help
avoid
economic
collapse
and
helped
to
involve
the
imf
and
the
banking
community
to
bring
about
economic
stability
and
we
have
worked
closely
with
the
new
leaders
to
maintain
liberias
strong
ties
with
the
west
and
to
protect
americas
vital
interests
north
africa
in
early
following
a
libyaninspired
commando
attack
on
a
tunisian
provincial
city
the
us
responded
promptly
to
tunisias
urgent
request
for
assistance
both
by
airlifting
needed
military
equipment
and
by
making
clear
our
longstanding
interest
in
the
security
and
integrity
of
this
friendly
country
the
us
remains
determined
to
oppose
other
irresponsible
libyan
aspirations
despairing
of
a
productive
dialogue
with
the
libyan
authorities
the
us
closed
down
its
embassy
in
libya
and
later
expelled
six
libyan
diplomats
in
washington
in
order
to
deter
an
intimidation
campaign
against
libyan
citizens
in
the
us
us
relations
with
algeria
have
improved
and
algeria
has
played
an
indispensable
and
effective
role
as
intermediary
between
iran
and
the
us
over
the
hostage
issue
the
strengthening
of
our
arms
supply
relationship
with
morocco
has
helped
to
deal
with
attacks
inside
its
internationally
recognized
frontiers
and
to
strengthen
its
confidence
in
seeking
a
political
settlement
of
the
western
sahara
conflict
while
not
assuming
a
mediatory
role
the
us
encouraged
all
interested
parties
to
turn
their
energies
to
a
peaceful
and
sensible
compromise
resolution
of
the
war
in
the
sahara
and
supported
efforts
by
the
organization
of
african
unity
toward
that
end
as
the
year
drew
to
a
close
the
us
was
encouraged
by
evolution
in
the
attitudes
of
all
sides
and
is
hopeful
that
their
differences
will
be
peacefully
resolved
in
the
year
ahead
so
that
the
vast
economic
potential
of
north
africa
can
be
developed
for
the
wellbeing
of
the
people
living
there
latin
america
and
the
caribbean
the
principles
of
our
policies
in
this
hemisphere
have
been
clear
and
constant
over
the
last
four
years
we
support
democracy
and
respect
for
human
rights
we
have
struggled
with
many
to
help
free
the
region
of
both
repression
and
terrorism
we
have
respected
ideological
diversity
and
opposed
outside
intervention
in
purely
internal
affairs
we
will
act
though
in
response
to
a
request
for
assistance
by
a
country
threatened
by
external
aggression
we
support
social
and
economic
development
within
a
democratic
framework
we
support
the
peaceful
settlement
of
disputes
we
strongly
encourage
regional
cooperation
and
shared
responsibilities
within
the
hemisphere
to
all
these
ends
and
we
have
eagerly
and
regularly
sought
the
advice
of
the
leaders
of
the
region
on
a
wide
range
of
issues
last
november
i
spoke
to
the
general
assembly
of
the
organization
of
american
states
of
a
cause
that
has
been
closest
to
my
hearthuman
rights
it
is
an
issue
that
has
found
its
time
in
the
hemisphere
the
cause
is
not
mine
alone
but
an
historic
movement
that
will
endure
at
riobamba
ecuador
last
september
four
andean
pact
countries
costa
rica
and
panama
broke
new
ground
by
adopting
a
code
of
conduct
that
joint
action
in
defense
of
human
rights
does
not
violate
the
principles
of
nonintervention
in
the
internal
affairs
of
states
in
this
hemisphere
the
organization
of
american
states
has
twice
condemned
the
coup
that
overturned
the
democratic
process
in
bolivia
and
the
widespread
abuse
of
human
rights
by
the
regime
which
seized
power
the
interamerican
commission
on
human
rights
has
gained
world
acclaim
for
its
dispassionate
reports
it
completed
two
major
country
studies
this
year
in
addition
to
its
annual
report
in
a
resolution
adopted
without
opposition
the
oas
general
assembly
in
november
strongly
supported
the
work
of
the
commission
the
american
convention
on
human
rights
is
in
force
and
an
interamerican
court
has
been
created
to
judge
human
rights
violations
this
convention
has
been
pending
before
the
senate
for
two
years
i
hope
the
united
states
this
year
will
join
the
other
nations
of
the
hemisphere
in
ratifying
a
convention
which
embodies
principles
that
are
our
tradition
the
trend
in
favor
of
democracy
has
continued
during
this
past
year
peru
inaugurated
a
democratically
elected
government
brazil
continues
its
process
of
liberalization
in
central
america
hondurans
voted
in
record
numbers
in
their
first
national
elections
in
over
eight
years
in
the
caribbean
seven
elections
have
returned
governments
firmly
committed
to
the
democratic
traditions
of
the
commonwealth
another
major
contribution
to
peace
in
the
hemisphere
is
latin
americas
own
treaty
for
the
prohibition
of
nuclear
weapons
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
i
signed
protocol
i
of
this
treaty
in
may
of
and
sent
it
to
the
senate
for
ratification
i
urge
that
it
be
acted
upon
promptly
by
the
senate
in
order
that
it
be
brought
into
the
widest
possible
effect
in
the
latin
american
region
regional
cooperation
for
development
is
gaining
from
central
america
to
the
andes
and
throughout
the
caribbean
the
caribbean
group
for
cooperation
in
economic
development
which
we
established
with
other
nations
in
has
helped
channel
million
in
external
support
for
growth
in
the
caribbean
the
recent
meeting
of
the
chiefs
of
state
of
the
eastern
caribbean
set
a
new
precedent
for
cooperation
in
that
region
mexico
and
venezuela
jointly
and
trinidad
and
tobago
separately
have
established
oil
facilities
that
will
provide
substantial
assistance
to
their
oil
importing
neighbors
the
peace
treaty
between
el
salvador
and
honduras
will
hopefully
stimulate
central
america
to
move
forward
again
toward
economic
integration
formation
of
caribbean
central
american
action
a
private
sector
organization
has
given
a
major
impetus
to
improving
peopletopeople
bonds
and
strengthening
the
role
of
private
enterprise
in
the
development
of
democratic
societies
the
panama
treaties
have
been
in
force
for
over
a
year
a
new
partnership
has
been
created
with
panama
it
is
a
model
for
large
and
small
nations
a
longstanding
issue
that
divided
us
from
our
neighbors
has
been
resolved
the
security
of
the
canal
has
been
enhanced
the
canal
is
operating
as
well
as
ever
with
traffic
through
it
reaching
record
levels
this
year
canal
employees
american
and
panamanian
alike
have
remained
on
the
job
and
have
found
their
living
and
working
conditions
virtually
unchanged
in
relations
with
mexico
continued
to
improve
due
in
large
measure
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
coordinator
for
mexican
affairs
and
the
expanded
use
of
the
usmexico
consultative
mechanism
by
holding
periodic
meetings
of
its
various
working
groups
we
have
been
able
to
prevent
mutual
concerns
from
becoming
political
issues
the
secretary
of
state
visited
mexico
city
in
november
and
along
with
the
mexican
secretary
of
foreign
relations
reviewed
the
performance
of
the
consultative
mechanism
the
office
of
the
coordinator
has
ensured
the
implementation
of
my
directive
to
all
agencies
to
accord
high
priority
to
mexican
concerns
trade
with
mexico
rose
by
almost
percent
to
nearly
billion
making
that
country
our
third
largest
trading
partner
these
are
all
encouraging
developments
other
problems
remain
however
the
impact
of
largescale
migration
is
affecting
many
countries
in
the
hemisphere
the
most
serious
manifestation
was
the
massive
illegal
exodus
from
cuba
last
summer
the
cuban
government
unilaterally
encouraged
the
disorderly
and
even
deadly
migration
of
of
its
citizens
in
complete
disregard
for
international
law
or
the
immigration
laws
of
its
neighbors
migrations
of
this
nature
clearly
require
concerted
action
and
we
have
asked
the
oas
to
explore
means
of
dealing
with
similar
situations
which
may
occur
in
the
future
we
have
a
longstanding
treaty
with
colombia
on
quita
sueno
roncador
and
serrano
which
remains
to
be
ratified
by
the
senate
in
central
america
the
future
of
nicaragua
is
unclear
recent
tensions
the
restrictions
on
the
press
and
political
activity
an
inordinate
cuban
presence
in
the
country
and
the
tragic
killing
by
the
security
forces
of
a
businessman
well
known
for
his
democratic
orientation
cause
us
considerable
concern
these
are
not
encouraging
developments
but
those
who
seek
a
free
society
remain
in
the
contest
for
their
nations
destiny
they
have
asked
us
to
help
rebuild
their
country
and
by
our
assistance
to
demonstrate
that
the
democratic
nations
do
not
intend
to
abandon
nicaragua
to
the
cubans
as
long
as
those
who
intend
to
pursue
their
pluralistic
goals
play
important
roles
in
nicaragua
it
deserves
our
continuing
support
in
el
salvador
we
have
supported
the
efforts
of
the
junta
to
change
the
fundamental
basis
of
an
inequitable
system
and
to
give
a
stake
in
a
new
nation
to
those
millions
of
people
who
for
so
long
lived
without
hope
or
dignity
as
the
government
struggles
against
those
who
would
restore
an
old
tyranny
or
impose
a
new
one
the
united
states
will
continue
to
stand
behind
them
we
have
increased
our
aid
to
the
caribbean
an
area
vital
to
our
national
security
and
we
should
continue
to
build
close
relations
based
on
mutual
respect
and
understanding
and
common
interests
as
the
nations
of
this
hemisphere
prepare
to
move
further
into
the
s
i
am
struck
by
the
depth
of
underlying
commitment
that
there
is
to
our
common
principles
nonintervention
peaceful
settlement
of
disputes
cooperation
for
development
democracy
and
defense
of
basic
human
rights
i
leave
office

has
vividly
demonstrated
once

both
the

our

are
of
major
importance
to
the

the
fabric
of
our
relations
with
these

has
strong
economic
and
political
dimensions
they
constitute
the
most
rapidly
growing
markets
for
our

and
are
important
sources
of

their
political

are
increasingly
important
as

our

we
have
in

their

the

our

require
us
to
maintain
the
policy
of
active
involvement
with
the

that
we
have
pursued
over
the

four
years
the
actions
we
have
taken
in
such
areas
as

trade
commodities
and
international

are
all
important
to
the
welfare
of
the

another
important
way
the
united

can
directly
assist
these
countries
and
demonstrate
our
concern
for

is
through
our

directly
responsive
to
the

reached
at
the
venice
economic

that
the
major

should
increase
their
aid
for
food
and
energy
production
and
for

we
understand
that
other
summit
countries
plan
similar
responses
it
is
also
important
to
honor
our
international
agreements
for
multilateral
assistance
by
authorizing
and
appropriating

for
the
international

these
multilateral

enhance
the

combining

with
those
of

all
these

our
longrun
economic

interests
progress
was
made
on
a
number
of
economic
issues
in
negotiations
throughout
the
un
system
however
in
spite
of
lengthy
efforts
in
the
united

agreement
has
not
been
reached
on
how
to
launch
a
process
of
global
negotiations
in
which
nations
might
collectively
work
to
solve
such
important
issues
as
energy
food
protectionism
and
population
pressures
the
united

continues
to
believe
that
progress
can
best
be
made
when
nations
focus
on
such
specific
problems
rather
than
on
procedural
and
institutional
questions
it
will
continue
to
work

the

on

must
be
a
continuous
urgent
priority
major
portions
of
the
worlds
population
continue
to
be
threatened
by
the
specter
of
hunger
and
malnutrition
during
the
past
year
some
million
people
in
african
countries
were
faced
with
near
disaster
as
the
result
of
serious
drought
induced
food
shortages
our
government
working
in
concert
with
the
uns
food
and
agricultural
organization
fao
helped
to
respond
to
that
need
but
the
problems
of
hunger
cannot
be
solved
by
shortterm
measures
we
must
continue
to
support
those
activities
bilateral
and
multilateral
which
aim
at
improving
food
production
especially
in
developing
countries
and
assuring
global
food

these
measures
are
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
a
stable
and
healthy

economy
i
am
pleased
that
negotiation
of
a
new
food
aid
convention
which
guarantees
a
minimum
annual
level
of

was
successfully
concluded
in

the

will
enable
the
us
to
meet
its
commitment
under
the
new
convention
to
feed
hungry
people
even
in
times
of
short
supply
of
immediate
concern
is
the
prospect
of
millions
of
africans
threatened
by
famine
because
of
drought
and
civil
disturbances
the
us
plea
for
increased
food
aid
resulted
in
the
organization
of
an
international
pledging
conference
and
we
are
hopeful
that
widespread
starvation
will
be
avoided
good
progress
has
been
made

on

we
and
other

countries
have
begun
to
assist
poor
countries
develop
longterm
strategies
to
improve
their
food
production
the

will
invest
up
to

in
the
next
few
years
in
improving
the
grain
storage
and
foodhandling
capacity
of

prone
to

good
progress
has
been
made
since
the
tokyo
economic

called
for
increased

on
this

the
world
bank
is
giving
this
problem
top
priority
as
are
some
other
donor
countries
the
resources
of
the
consultative
group
on

agricultural
research
will
be
doubled
over
a
fiveyear
period
the
work
of
our
own
institute
of
scientific

technological
cooperation
will
further
strengthen
the
search
for
relevant
new
agricultural
technologies
the
goal
of
freeing
the

from

by

the
human

policy
of
the
united

has
been
an
integral
part
of
our
overall
foreign
policy
for
the
past
several
years
this
policy
serves
the
national
interest
of
the
united
states
in
several
important
ways
by
encouraging
respect
by
governments
for
the
basic
rights
of
human
beings
it
promotes
peaceful
constructive
change
reduces
the
likelihood
of
internal
pressures
for
violent
change
and
for
the
exploitation
of
these
by
our
adversaries
and
thus
directly
serves
our
longterm
interest
in
peace
and
stability
by
matching
espousal
of
fundamental
american
principles
of
freedom
with
specific
foreign
policy
actions
we
stand
out
in
vivid
contrast
to
our
ideological
adversaries
by
our
efforts
to
expand
freedom
elsewhere
we
render
our
own
freedom
and
our
own
nation
more
secure
countries
that
respect
human

make
stronger

and
better
friends
rather
than
attempt
to
dictate
what

of

other

should
have
the
us
supports
throughout
the
world
the
internationally
recognized
human

which
all
members
of
the
united

have
pledged
themselves
to
respect
there
is
more
than
one
model
that
can
satisfy
the
continuing
human
reach
for
freedom
and
justice
has
been
a
year
of
some
disappointments
but
has
also
seen
some
positive
developments
in
the
ongoing
struggle
for
fulfillment
of

throughout

the

credit
for
all
these

we
can
take
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
our

perhaps
influence
them

who
see
a
contradiction
between
our

that
the
basis
for
a

is
the
bond
of

i
profoundly
believe
that
the
future
of
our

is
not
to
be
found
in
authoritarianism
that
wears
the
mask
of

or
totalitarianism
that
wears
the

instead
let
us
find

the
leadership
exercised
in
the
international
arena
by
the
united
states
we
have
played
the
pivotal
role
in
ameliorating
massive
suffering
in
kampuchea
the
united

has
taken
the
lead
among
a
group
of

here
again
united

efforts
can
in
large
part
be
credited
with
keeping
hundreds
of
thousands
of

alive
another
major
international
relief
effort
has
been
mounted
in
pakistan
the
united
states
is
one
of
countries
plus
the
european
economic
community
who
have
been
helping
the
government
of
pakistan
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
feeding
and
sheltering
the
more
than
one
million
refugees
that
have
been
generated
by
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
in
april
the
congress
passed
the
refugee
act
of
which
brought
together
for
the
first
time
in
one
piece
of
legislation
the
various
threads
of
us
policy
towards
refugees
the
law
laid
down
a
new
broader
definition
of
the
term
refugee
established
mechanisms
for
arriving
at
a
level
of
refugee
admissions
through
consultation
with
congress
and
established
the
office
of
the
united
states
coordinator
for
refugees
it
cannot
be
ignored
that
the
destructive
and
aggressive
policies
of
the
soviet
union
have
added
immeasurably
to
the
suffering
in
these
three
tragic
situations
the
control
of
nuclear
weapons
together
with
our
friends
and
allies
we
are
striving
to
build
a
world
in
which
peoples
with
diverse
interests
can
live
freely
and
prosper
but
all
that
humankind
has
achieved
to
date
all
that
we
are
seeking
to
accomplish
and
human
existence
itself
can
be
undone
in
an
instantin
the
catastrophe
of
a
nuclear
war
thus
one
of
the
central
objectives
of
my
administration
has
been
to
control
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
to
those
nations
which
do
not
have
them
and
their
further
development
by
the
existing
nuclear
powers
notably
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
nonproliferation
my
administration
has
been
committed
to
stemming
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
nuclear
proliferation
would
raise
the
spectre
of
the
use
of
nuclear
explosives
in
crucial
unstable
regions
of
the
world
endangering
not
only
our
security
and
that
of
our
allies
but
that
of
the
whole
world
nonproliferation
is
not
and
can
not
be
a
unilateral
us
policy
nor
should
it
be
an
issue
of
contention
between
the
industrialized
and
developing
states
the
international
nonproliferation
effort
requires
the
support
of
suppliers
as
well
as
importers
of
nuclear
technology
and
materials
we
have
been
proceeding
on
a
number
of
fronts
first
we
have
been
seeking
to
encourage
nations
to
accede
to
the
nonproliferation
treaty
the
us
is
also
actively
encouraging
other
nations
to
accept
fullscope
safeguards
on
all
of
their
nuclear
activities
and
is
asking
other
nuclear
suppliers
to
adopt
a
fullscope
safeguards
requirement
as
a
condition
for
future
supply
second
the
international
nuclear
fuel
cycle
evaluation
infce
which
was
completed
in
demonstrated
that
suppliers
and
recipients
can
work
together
on
these
technically
complex
and
sensitive
issues
while
differences
remain
the
infce
effort
provides
a
broader
international
basis
for
national
decisions
which
must
balance
energy
needs
with
nonproliferation
concerns
finally
we
are
working
to
encourage
regional
cooperation
and
restraint
protocol
i
of
the
treaty
of
tlatelolco
which
will
contribute
to
the
lessening
of
nuclear
dangers
for
our
latin
american
neighbors
ought
now
to
be
ratified
by
the
united
states
senate
limitations
on
strategic
arms
i
remain
convinced
that
the
salt
ii
treaty
is
in
our
nations
security
interest
and
that
it
would
add
significantly
to
the
control
of
nuclear
weapons
i
strongly
support
continuation
of
the
salt
process
and
the
negotiation
of
more
farreaching
mutual
restraints
on
nuclear
weaponry
conclusion
we
have
new
support
in
the
world
for
our
purposes
of
national
independence
and
individual
human
dignity
we
have
a
new
will
at
home
to
do
what
is
required
to
keep
us
the
strongest
nation
on
earth
we
must
move
together
into
this
decade
with
the
strength
which
comes
from
realization
of
the
dangers
before
us
and
from
the
confidence
that
together
we
can
overcome
them
