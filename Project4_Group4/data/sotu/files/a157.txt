to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
a
quarter
century
ago
the
congress
decided
that
it
could
no
longer
consider
the
financial
programs
of
the
various
departments
on
a
piecemeal
basis
instead
it
has
called
on
the
president
to
present
a
comprehensive
executive
budget
the
congress
has
shown
its
satisfaction
with
that
method
by
extending
the
budget
system
and
tightening
its
controls
the
bigger
and
more
complex
the
federal
program
the
more
necessary
it
is
for
the
chief
executive
to
submit
a
single
budget
for
action
by
the
congress
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
the
budgetary
program
and
the
general
program
of
the
government
are
actually
inseparable
the
president
bears
the
responsibility
for
recommending
to
the
congress
a
comprehensive
set
of
proposals
on
all
government
activities
and
their
financing
in
formulating
policies
as
in
preparing
budgetary
estimates
the
nation
and
the
congress
have
the
right
to
expect
the
president
to
adjust
and
coordinate
the
views
of
the
various
departments
and
agencies
to
form
a
unified
program
and
that
program
requires
consideration
in
connection
with
the
budget
which
is
the
annual
work
program
of
the
government
since
our
programs
for
this
period
which
combines
war
liquidation
with
reconversion
to
a
peacetime
economy
are
inevitably
large
and
numerous
it
is
imperative
that
they
be
planned
and
executed
with
the
utmost
efficiency
and
the
utmost
economy
we
have
cut
the
war
program
to
the
maximum
extent
consistent
with
national
security
we
have
held
our
peacetime
programs
to
the
level
necessary
to
our
national
wellbeing
and
the
attainment
of
our
postwar
objectives
where
increased
programs
have
been
recommended
the
increases
have
been
held
as
low
as
is
consistent
with
these
goals
i
can
assure
the
congress
of
the
necessity
of
these
programs
i
can
further
assure
the
congress
that
the
program
as
a
whole
is
well
within
our
capacity
to
finance
it
all
the
programs
i
have
recommended
for
action
are
included
in
the
budget
figures
for
these
reasons
i
have
chosen
to
combine
the
customary
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
with
the
annual
budget
message
and
to
include
in
the
budget
not
only
estimates
for
functions
authorized
by
the
congress
but
also
for
those
which
i
recommend
for
its
action
i
am
also
transmitting
herewith
the
fifth
quarterly
report
of
the
director
of
war
mobilization
and
reconversion
it
is
a
comprehensive
discussion
of
the
present
state
of
the
reconversion
program
and
of
the
immediate
and
longrange
needs
and
recommendations

this
constitutes
then
as
complete
a
report
as
i
find
it
possible
to
prepare
now
it
constitutes
a
program
of
government
in
relation
to
the
nations
needs
with
the
growing
responsibility
of
modern
government
to
foster
economic
expansion
and
to
promote
conditions
that
assure
full
and
steady
employment
opportunities
it
has
become
necessary
to
formulate
and
determine
the
government
program
in
the
light
of
national
economic
conditions
as
a
whole
in
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
we
must
make
arrangements
which
will
permit
us
to
formulate
the
government
program
in
that
light
such
an
approach
has
become
imperative
if
the
american
political
and
economic
system
is
to
succeed
under
the
conditions
of
economic
instability
and
uncertainty
which
we
have
to
face
the
government
needs
to
assure
business
labor
and
agriculture
that
government
policies
will
take
due
account
of
the
requirements
of
a
full
employment
economy
the
lack
of
that
assurance
would
i
believe
aggravate
the
economic
instability
with
the
passage
of
a
full
employment
bill
which
i
confidently
anticipate
for
the
very
near
future
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
government
will
be
empowered
to
devote
their
best
talents
and
resources
in
subsequent
years
to
preparing
and
acting
on
such
a
program
i
from
war
to
peacethe
year
of
decision
in
his
last
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
delivered
one
year
ago
president
roosevelt
said
this
new
year
of
can
be
the
greatest
year
of
achievement
in
human
history
can
see
the
final
ending
of
the
nazifascist
reign
of
terror
in
europe
can
see
the
closing
in
of
the
forces
of
retribution
about
the
center
of
the
malignant
power
of
imperialistic
japan
most
important
of
all
can
and
must
see
the
substantial
beginning
of
the
organization
of
world
peace
all
those
hopes
and
more
were
fulfilled
in
the
year
it
was
the
greatest
year
of
achievement
in
human
history
it
saw
the
end
of
the
nazifascist
terror
in
europe
and
also
the
end
of
the
malignant
power
of
japan
and
it
saw
the
substantial
beginning
of
world
organization
for
peace
these
momentous
events
became
realities
because
of
the
steadfast
purpose
of
the
united
nations
and
of
the
forces
that
fought
for
freedom
under
their
flags
the
plain
fact
is
that
civilization
was
saved
in
by
the
united
nations
our
own
part
in
this
accomplishment
was
not
the
product
of
any
single
service
those
who
fought
on
land
those
who
fought
on
the
sea
and
those
who
fought
in
the
air
deserve
equal
credit
they
were
supported
by
other
millions
in
the
armed
forces
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
could
not
go
overseas
and
who
rendered
indispensable
service
in
this
country
they
were
supported
by
millions
in
all
levels
of
government
including
many
volunteers
whose
devoted
public
service
furnished
basic
organization
and
leadership
they
were
also
supported
by
the
millions
of
americans
in
private
lifemen
and
women
in
industry
in
commerce
on
the
farms
and
in
all
manner
of
activity
on
the
home
frontwho
contributed
their
brains
and
their
brawn
in
arming
equipping
and
feeding
them
the
country
was
brought
through
four
years
of
peril
by
an
effort
that
was
truly
national
in
character
everlasting
tribute
and
gratitude
will
be
paid
by
all
americans
to
those
brave
men
who
did
not
come
back
who
will
never
come
backthe
who
died
that
the
nation
might
live
and
progress
all
americans
will
also
remain
deeply
conscious
of
the
obligation
owed
to
that
larger
number
of
soldiers
sailors
and
marines
who
suffered
wounds
and
sickness
in
their
service
they
may
be
certain
that
their
sacrifice
will
never
be
forgotten
or
their
needs
neglected
the
beginning
of
the
year
finds
the
united
states
strong
and
deservedly
confident
we
have
a
record
of
enormous
achievements
as
a
democratic
society
in
solving
problems
and
meeting
opportunities
as
they
developed
we
find
ourselves
possessed
of
immeasurable
advantagesvast
and
varied
natural
resources
great
plants
institutions
and
other
facilities
unsurpassed
technological
and
managerial
skills
an
alert
resourceful
and
able
citizenry
we
have
in
the
united
states
government
rich
resources
in
information
perspective
and
facilities
for
doing
whatever
may
be
found
necessary
to
do
in
giving
support
and
form
to
the
widespread
and
diversified
efforts
of
all
our
people
and
for
the
immediate
future
the
business
prospects
are
generally
so
favorable
that
there
is
danger
of
such
feverish
and
opportunistic
activity
that
our
grave
postwar
problems
may
be
neglected
we
need
to
act
now
with
full
regard
for
pitfalls
we
need
to
act
with
foresight
and
balance
we
should
not
be
lulled
by
the
immediate
alluring
prospects
into
forgetting
the
fundamental
complexity
of
modern
affairs
the
catastrophe
that
can
come
in
this
complexity
or
the
values
that
can
be
wrested
from
it
but
the
longrange
difficulties
we
face
should
no
more
lead
to
despair
than
our
immediate
business
prospects
should
lead
to
the
optimism
which
comes
from
the
present
shortrange
prospect
on
the
foundation
of
our
victory
we
can
build
a
lasting
peace
with
greater
freedom
and
security
for
mankind
in
our
country
and
throughout
the
world
we
will
more
certainly
do
this
if
we
are
constantly
aware
of
the
fact
that
we
face
crucial
issues
and
prepare
now
to
meet
them
to
achieve
success
will
require
both
boldness
in
setting
our
sights
and
caution
in
steering
our
way
on
an
uncharted
course
but
we
have
no
luxury
of
choice
we
must
move
ahead
no
return
to
the
past
is
possible
our
nation
has
always
been
a
land
of
great
opportunities
for
those
people
of
the
world
who
sought
to
become
part
of
us
now
we
have
become
a
land
of
great
responsibilities
to
all
the
people
of
all
the
world
we
must
squarely
recognize
and
face
the
fact
of
those
responsibilities
advances
in
science
in
communication
in
transportation
have
compressed
the
world
into
a
community
the
economic
and
political
health
of
each
member
of
the
world
community
bears
directly
on
the
economic
and
political
health
of
each
other
member
the
evolution
of
centuries
has
brought
us
to
a
new
era
in
world
history
in
which
manifold
relationships
between
nations
must
be
formalized
and
developed
in
new
and
intricate
ways
the
united
nations
organization
now
being
established
represents
a
minimum
essential
beginning
it
must
be
developed
rapidly
and
steadily
its
work
must
be
amplified
to
fill
in
the
whole
pattern
that
has
been
outlined
economic
collaboration
for
example
already
charted
now
must
be
carried
on
as
carefully
and
as
comprehensively
as
the
political
and
security
measures
it
is
important
that
the
nations
come
together
as
states
in
the
assembly
and
in
the
security
council
and
in
the
other
specialized
assemblies
and
councils
that
have
been
and
will
be
arranged
but
this
is
not
enough
our
ultimate
security
requires
more
than
a
process
of
consultation
and
compromise
it
requires
that
we
begin
now
to
develop
the
united
nations
organization
as
the
representative
of
the
world
as
one
society
the
united
nations
organization
if
we
have
the
will
adequately
to
staff
it
and
to
make
it
work
as
it
should
will
provide
a
great
voice
to
speak
constantly
and
responsibly
in
terms
of
world
collaboration
and
world
wellbeing
there
are
many
new
responsibilities
for
us
as
we
enter
into
this
new
international
era
the
whole
power
and
will
and
wisdom
of
our
government
and
of
our
people
should
be
focused
to
contribute
to
and
to
influence
international
action
it
is
intricate
continuing
business
many
concessions
and
adjustments
will
be
required
the
spectacular
progress
of
science
in
recent
years
makes
these
necessities
more
vivid
and
urgent
that
progress
has
speeded
internal
development
and
has
changed
world
relationships
so
fast
that
we
must
realize
the
fact
of
a
new
era
it
is
an
era
in
which
affairs
have
become
complex
and
rich
in
promise
delicate
and
intricate
relationships
involving
us
all
in
countless
ways
must
be
carefully
considered
on
the
domestic
scene
as
well
as
on
the
international
scene
we
must
lay
a
new
and
better
foundation
for
cooperation
we
face
a
great
peacetime
venture
the
challenging
venture
of
a
free
enterprise
economy
making
full
and
effective
use
of
its
rich
resources
and
technical
advances
this
is
a
venture
in
which
business
agriculture
and
labor
have
vastly
greater
opportunities
than
heretofore
but
they
all
also
have
vastly
greater
responsibilities
we
will
not
measure
up
to
those
responsibilities
by
the
simple
return
to
normalcy
that
was
tried
after
the
last
war
the
general
objective
on
the
contrary
is
to
move
forward
to
find
the
way
in
time
of
peace
to
the
full
utilization
and
development
of
our
physical
and
human
resources
that
were
demonstrated
so
effectively
in
the
war
to
accomplish
this
it
is
not
intended
that
the
federal
government
should
do
things
that
can
be
done
as
well
for
the
nation
by
private
enterprise
or
by
state
and
local
governments
on
the
contrary
the
war
has
demonstrated
how
effectively
we
can
organize
our
productive
system
and
develop
the
potential
abilities
of
our
people
by
aiding
the
efforts
of
private
enterprise
as
we
move
toward
one
common
objective
there
will
be
many
and
urgent
problems
to
meet
industrial
peace
between
management
and
labor
will
have
to
be
achievedthrough
the
process
of
collective
bargainingwith
government
assistance
but
not
government
compulsion
this
is
a
problem
which
is
the
concern
not
only
of
management
labor
and
the
government
but
also
the
concern
of
every
one
of
us
private
capital
and
private
management
are
entitled
to
adequate
reward
for
efficiency
but
business
must
recognize
that
its
reward
results
from
the
employment
of
the
resources
of
the
nation
business
is
a
public
trust
and
must
adhere
to
national
standards
in
the
conduct
of
its
affairs
these
standards
include
as
a
minimum
the
establishment
of
fair
wages
and
fair
employment
practices
labor
also
has
its
own
new
peacetime
responsibilities
under
our
collective
bargaining
system
which
must
become
progressively
more
secure
labor
attains
increasing
political
as
well
as
economic
power
and
this
as
with
all
power
means
increased
responsibility
the
lives
of
millions
of
veterans
and
war
workers
will
be
greatly
affected
by
the
success
or
failure
of
our
program
of
war
liquidation
and
reconversion
their
transition
to
peacetime
pursuits
will
be
determined
by
our
efforts
to
break
the
bottlenecks
in
key
items
of
production
to
make
surplus
property
immediately
available
where
it
is
needed
to
maintain
an
effective
national
employment
service
and
many
other
reconversion
policies
our
obligations
to
the
people
who
won
the
war
will
not
be
paid
if
we
fail
to
prevent
inflation
and
to
maintain
employment
opportunities
while
our
peacetime
prosperity
will
be
based
on
the
private
enterprise
the
government
can
and
must
assist
in
many
ways
it
is
the
governments
responsibility
to
see
that
our
economic
system
remains
competitive
that
new
businesses
have
adequate
opportunities
and
that
our
national
resources
are
restored
and
improved
government
must
realize
the
effect
of
its
operations
on
the
whole
economy
it
is
the
responsibility
of
government
to
gear
its
total
program
to
the
achievement
of
full
production
and
full
employment
our
basic
objectivetoward
which
all
others
leadis
to
improve
the
welfare
of
the
american
people
in
addition
to
economic
prosperity
this
means
that
we
use
social
security
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
and
people
must
be
protected
from
excessive
want
during
old
age
sickness
and
unemployment
opportunities
for
a
good
economy
and
adequate
medical
care
must
be
readily
available
every
family
should
build
a
decent
home
the
new
economic
rights
to
which
i
have
referred
on
previous
occasions
is
a
charter
of
economic
freedom
which
seeks
to
assure
that
all
who
will
may
work
toward
their
own
security
and
the
general
advancement
that
we
become
a
wellhoused
people
a
wellnourished
people
an
educated
people
a
people
socially
and
economically
secure
an
alert
and
responsible
people
these
and
other
problems
which
may
face
us
can
be
met
by
the
cooperation
of
all
of
us
in
furthering
a
positive
and
wellbalanced
government
programa
program
which
will
further
national
and
international
wellbeing
ii
the

foreign
policy
the
year
brought
with
it
the
final
defeat
of
our
enemies
there
lies
before
us
now
the
work
of
building
a
just
and
enduring
peace
our
most
immediate
task
toward
that
end
is
to
deprive
our
enemies
completely
and
forever
of
their
power
to
start
another
war
of
even
greater
importance
to
the
preservation
of
international
peace
is
the
need
to
preserve
the
wartime
agreement
of
the
united
nations
and
to
direct
it
into
the
ways
of
peace
long
before
our
enemies
surrendered
the
foundations
had
been
laid
on
which
to
continue
this
unity
in
the
peace
to
come
the
atlantic
meeting
in
and
the
conferences
at
casablanca
quebec
moscow
cairo
tehran
and
dumbarton
oaks
each
added
a
stone
to
the
structure
early
in
at
yalta
the
three
major
powers
broadened
and
solidified
this
base
of
understanding
there
fundamental
decisions
were
reached
concerning
the
occupation
and
control
of
germany
there
also
a
formula
was
arrived
at
for
the
interim
government
of
the
areas
in
europe
which
were
rapidly
being
wrested
from
nazi
control
this
formula
was
based
on
the
policy
of
the
united
states
that
people
be
permitted
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
by
their
own
freely
expressed
choice
without
interference
from
any
foreign
source
at
potsdam
in

marshal
stalin
prime
ministers
churchill
and
attlee
and
i
met
to
exchange
views
primarily
with
respect
to
germany
as
a
result
agreements
were
reached
which
outlined
broadly
the
policy
to
be
executed
by
the
allied
control
council
at
potsdam
there
was
also
established
a
council
of
foreign
ministers
which
convened
for
the
first
time
in
london
in
september
the
council
is
about
to
resume
its
primary
assignment
of
drawing
up
treaties
of
peace
with
italy
rumania
bulgaria
hungary
and
finland
in
addition
to
these
meetings
and
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
at
yalta
the
foreign
ministers
of
great
britain
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
conferred
together
in
san
francisco
last
spring
in
potsdam
in
july
in
london
in
september
and
in
moscow
in
december
these
meetings
have
been
useful
in
promoting
understanding
and
agreement
among
the
three
governments
simply
to
name
all
the
international
meetings
and
conferences
is
to
suggest
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
undertaking
to
prevent
international
war
in
which
the
united
states
has
now
enlisted
for
the
duration
of
history
it
is
encouraging
to
know
that
the
common
effort
of
the
united
nations
to
learn
to
live
together
did
not
cease
with
the
surrender
of
our
enemies
when
difficulties
arise
among
us
the
united
states
does
not
propose
to
remove
them
by
sacrificing
its
ideals
or
its
vital
interests
neither
do
we
propose
however
to
ignore
the
ideals
and
vital
interests
of
our
friends
last
february
and
march
an
interamerican
conference
on
problems
of
war
and
peace
was
held
in
mexico
city
among
the
many
significant
accomplishments
of
that
conference
was
an
understanding
that
an
attack
by
any
country
against
any
one
of
the
sovereign
american
republics
would
be
considered
an
act
of
aggression
against
all
of
them
and
that
if
such
an
attack
were
made
or
threatened
the
american
republics
would
decide
jointly
through
consultations
in
which
each
republic
has
equal
representation
what
measures
they
would
take
for
their
mutual
protection
this
agreement
stipulates
that
its
execution
shall
be
in
full
accord
with
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
organization
the
first
meeting
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
united
nations
now
in
progress
in
london
marks
the
real
beginning
of
our
bold
adventure
toward
the
preservation
of
world
peace
to
which
is
bound
the
dearest
hope
of
men
we
have
solemnly
dedicated
ourselves
and
all
our
will
to
the
success
of
the
united
nations
organization
for
this
reason
we
have
sought
to
insure
that
in
the
peacemaking
the
smaller
nations
shall
have
a
voice
as
well
as
the
larger
states
the
agreement
reached
at
moscow
last
month
preserves
this
opportunity
in
the
making
of
peace
with
italy
rumania
bulgaria
hungary
and
finland
the
united
states
intends
to
preserve
it
when
the
treaties
with
germany
and
japan
are
drawn
it
will
be
the
continuing
policy
of
the
united
states
to
use
all
its
influence
to
foster
support
and
develop
the
united
nations
organization
in
its
purpose
of
preventing
international
war
if
peace
is
to
endure
it
must
rest
upon
justice
no
less
than
upon
power
the
question
is
how
justice
among
nations
is
best
achieved
we
know
from
daytoday
experience
that
the
chance
for
a
just
solution
is
immeasurably
increased
when
everyone
directly
interested
is
given
a
voice
that
does
not
mean
that
each
must
enjoy
an
equal
voice
but
it
does
mean
that
each
must
be
heard
last
november
prime
minister
attlee
prime
minister
mackenzie
king
and
i
announced
our
proposal
that
a
commission
be
established
within
the
framework
of
the
united
nations
to
explore
the
problems
of
effective
international
control
of
atomic
energy
the
soviet
union
france
and
china
have
joined
us
in
the
purpose
of
introducing
in
the
general
assembly
a
resolution
for
the
establishment
of
such
a
commission
our
earnest
wish
is
that
the
work
of
this
commission
go
forward
carefully
and
thoroughly
but
with
the
greatest
dispatch
i
have
great
hope
for
the
development
of
mutually
effective
safeguards
which
will
permit
the
fullest
international
control
of
this
new
atomic
force
i
believe
it
possible
that
effective
means
can
be
developed
through
the
united
nations
organization
to
prohibit
outlaw
and
prevent
the
use
of
atomic
energy
for
destructive
purposes
the
power
which
the
united
states
demonstrated
during
the
war
is
the
fact
that
underlies
every
phase
of
our
relations
with
other
countries
we
cannot
escape
the
responsibility
which
it
thrusts
upon
us
what
we
think
plan
say
and
do
is
of
profound
significance
to
the
future
of
every
corner
of
the
world
the
great
and
dominant
objective
of
united
states
foreign
policy
is
to
build
and
preserve
a
just
peace
the
peace
we
seek
is
not
peace
for
twenty
years
it
is
permanent
peace
at
a
time
when
massive
changes
are
occurring
with
lightning
speed
throughout
the
world
it
is
often
difficult
to
perceive
how
this
central
objective
is
best
served
in
one
isolated
complex
situation
or
another
despite
this
very
real
difficulty
there
are
certain
basic
propositions
to
which
the
united
states
adheres
and
to
which
we
shall
continue
to
adhere
one
proposition
is
that
lasting
peace
requires
genuine
understanding
and
active
cooperation
among
the
most
powerful
nations
another
is
that
even
the
support
of
the
strongest
nations
cannot
guarantee
a
peace
unless
it
is
infused
with
the
quality
of
justice
for
all
nations
on
october
i
made
in
new
york
city
the
following
public
statement
of
my
understanding
of
the
fundamental
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
i
believe
that
policy
to
be
in
accord
with
the
opinion
of
the
congress
and
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
believe
that
that
policy
carries
out
our
fundamental
objectives
we
seek
no
territorial
expansion
or
selfish
advantage
we
have
no
plans
for
aggression
against
any
other
state
large
or
small
we
have
no
objective
which
need
clash
with
the
peaceful
aims
of
any
other
nation
we
believe
in
the
eventual
return
of
sovereign
rights
and
selfgovernment
to
all
peoples
who
have
been
deprived
of
them
by
force
we
shall
approve
no
territorial
changes
in
any
friendly
part
of
the
world
unless
they
accord
with
the
freely
expressed
wishes
of
the
people
concerned
we
believe
that
all
peoples
who
are
prepared
for
selfgovernment
should
be
permitted
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
by
their
own
freely
expressed
choice
without
interference
from
any
foreign
source
that
is
true
in
europe
in
asia
in
africa
as
well
as
in
the
western
hemisphere
by
the
combined
and
cooperative
action
of
our
war
allies
we
shall
help
the
defeated
enemy
states
establish
peaceful
democratic
governments
of
their
own
free
choice
and
we
shall
try
to
attain
a
world
in
which
nazism
fascism
and
military
aggression
cannot
exist
we
shall
refuse
to
recognize
any
government
imposed
upon
any
nation
by
the
force
of
any
foreign
power
in
some
cases
it
may
be
impossible
to
prevent
forceful
imposition
of
such
a
government
but
the
united
states
will
not
recognize
any
such
government
we
believe
that
all
nations
should
have
the
freedom
of
the
seas
and
equal
rights
to
the
navigation
of
boundary
rivers
and
waterways
and
of
rivers
and
waterways
which
pass
through
more
than
one
country
we
believe
that
all
states
which
are
accepted
in
the
society
of
nations
should
have
access
on
equal
terms
to
the
trade
and
the
raw
materials
of
the
world
we
believe
that
the
sovereign
states
of
the
western
hemisphere
without
interference
from
outside
the
western
hemisphere
must
work
together
as
good
neighbors
in
the
solution
of
their
common
problems
we
believe
that
full
economic
collaboration
between
all
nations
great
and
small
is
essential
to
the
improvement
of
living
conditions
all
over
the
world
and
to
the
establishment
of
freedom
from
fear
and
freedom
from
want
we
shall
continue
to
strive
to
promote
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
of
religion
throughout
the
peaceloving
areas
of
the
world
we
are
convinced
that
the
preservation
of
peace
between
nations
requires
a
united
nations
organization
composed
of
all
the
peaceloving
nations
of
the
world
who
are
willing
jointly
to
use
force
if
necessary
to
insure
peace
that
is
our
foreign
policy
we
may
not
always
fully
succeed
in
our
objectives
there
may
be
instances
where
the
attainment
of
those
objectives
is
delayed
but
we
will
not
give
our
full
sanction
and
approval
to
actions
which
fly
in
the
face
of
these
ideals
the
world
has
a
great
stake
in
the
political
and
economic
future
of
germany
the
allied
control
council
has
now
been
in
operation
there
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
it
has
not
met
with
unqualified
success
the
accommodation
of
varying
views
of
four
governments
in
the
daytoday
civil
administration
of
occupied
territory
is
a
challenging
task
in
my
judgment
however
the
council
has
made
encouraging
progress
in
the
face
of
most
serious
difficulties
it
is
my
purpose
at
the
earliest
practicable
date
to
transfer
from
military
to
civilian
personnel
the
execution
of
united
states
participation
in
the
government
of
occupied
territory
in
europe
we
are
determined
that
effective
control
shall
be
maintained
in
germany
until
we
are
satisfied
that
the
german
people
have
regained
the
right
to
a
place
of
honor
and
respect
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
a
method
of
international
cooperation
has
recently
been
agreed
upon
for
the
treatment
of
japan
in
this
pattern
of
control
the
united
states
with
the
full
approval
of
its
partners
has
retained
primary
authority
and
primary
responsibility
it
will
continue
to
do
so
until
the
japanese
people
by
their
own
freely
expressed
choice
choose
their
own
form
of
government
our
basic
policy
in
the
far
east
is
to
encourage
the
development
of
a
strong
independent
united
and
democratic
china
that
has
been
the
traditional
policy
of
the
united
states
at
moscow
the
united
states
the
union
of
soviet
socialist
republics
and
great
britain
agreed
to
further
this
development
by
supporting
the
efforts
of
the
national
government
and
nongovernmental
chinese
political
elements
in
bringing
about
cessation
of
civil
strife
and
in
broadening
the
basis
of
representation
in
the
government
that
is
the
policy
which
general
marshall
is
so
ably
executing
today
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
proceed
as
rapidly
as
is
practicable
toward
the
restoration
of
the
sovereignty
of
korea
and
the
establishment
of
a
democratic
government
by
the
free
choice
of
the
people
of
korea
at
the
threshold
of
every
problem
which
confronts
us
today
in
international
affairs
is
the
appalling
devastation
hunger
sickness
and
pervasive
human
misery
that
mark
so
many
areas
of
the
world
by
joining
and
participating
in
the
work
of
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
the
united
states
has
directly
recognized
and
assumed
an
obligation
to
give
such
relief
assistance
as
is
practicable
to
millions
of
innocent
and
helpless
victims
of
the
war
the
congress
has
earned
the
gratitude
of
the
world
by
generous
financial
contributions
to
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
we
have
taken
the
lead
modest
though
it
is
in
facilitating
under
our
existing
immigration
quotas
the
admission
to
the
united
states
of
refugees
and
displaced
persons
from
europe
we
have
joined
with
great
britain
in
the
organization
of
a
commission
to
study
the
problem
of
palestine
the
commission
is
already
at
work
and
its
recommendations
will
be
made
at
an
early
date
the
members
of
the
united
nations
have
paid
us
the
high
compliment
of
choosing
the
united
states
as
the
site
of
the
united
nations
headquarters
we
shall
be
host
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
fact
for
nowhere
does
there
abide
a
fiercer
determination
that
this
peace
shall
live
than
in
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
it
is
the
hope
of
all
americans
that
in
time
future
historians
will
speak
not
of
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii
but
of
the
first
and
last
world
wars
foreign
economic
policy
the
foreign
economic
policy
of
the
united
states
is
designed
to
promote
our
own
prosperity
and
at
the
same
time
to
aid
in
the
restoration
and
expansion
of
world
markets
and
to
contribute
thereby
to
world
peace
and
world
security
we
shall
continue
our
efforts
to
provide
relief
from
the
devastation
of
war
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
displaced
persons
to
assist
in
reconstruction
and
development
and
to
promote
the
expansion
of
world
trade
we
have
already
joined
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
international
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
we
have
expanded
the
exportimport
bank
and
provided
it
with
additional
capital
the
congress
has
renewed
the
trade
agreements
act
which
provides
the
necessary
framework
within
which
to
negotiate
a
reduction
of
trade
barriers
on
a
reciprocal
basis
it
has
given
our
support
to
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
in
accordance
with
the
intentions
of
the
congress
lendlease
except
as
to
continuing
military
lendlease
in
china
was
terminated
upon
the
surrender
of
japan
the
first
of
the
lendlease
settlement
agreements
has
been
completed
with
the
united
kingdom
negotiations
with
other
lendlease
countries
are
in
progress
in
negotiating
these
agreements
we
intend
to
seek
settlements
which
will
not
encumber
world
trade
through
war
debts
of
a
character
that
proved
to
be
so
detrimental
to
the
stability
of
the
world
economy
after
the
last
war
we
have
taken
steps
to
dispose
of
the
goods
which
on
vjday
were
in
the
lendlease
pipe
line
to
the
various
lendlease
countries
and
to
allow
them
longterm
credit
for
the
purpose
where
necessary
we
are
also
making
arrangements
under
which
those
countries
may
use
the
lendlease
inventories
in
their
possession
and
acquire
surplus
property
abroad
to
assist
in
their
economic
rehabilitation
and
reconstruction
these
goods
will
be
accounted
for
at
fair
values
the
proposed
loan
to
the
united
kingdom
which
i
shall
recommend
to
the
congress
in
a
separate
message
will
contribute
to
easing
the
transition
problem
of
one
of
our
major
partners
in
the
war
it
will
enable
the
whole
sterling
area
and
other
countries
affiliated
with
it
to
resume
trade
on
a
multilateral
basis
extension
of
this
credit
will
enable
the
united
kingdom
to
avoid
discriminatory
trade
arrangements
of
the
type
which
destroyed
freedom
of
trade
during
the
s
i
consider
the
progress
toward
multilateral
trade
which
will
be
achieved
by
this
agreement
to
be
in
itself
sufficient
warrant
for
the
credit
the
view
of
this
government
is
that
in
the
longer
run
our
economic
prosperity
and
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
world
are
best
served
by
the
elimination
of
artificial
barriers
to
international
trade
whether
in
the
form
of
unreasonable
tariffs
or
tariff
preferences
or
commercial
quotas
or
embargoes
or
the
restrictive
practices
of
cartels
the
united
states
government
has
issued
proposals
for
the
expansion
of
world
trade
and
employment
to
which
the
government
of
the
united
kingdom
has
given
its
support
on
every
important
issue
these
proposals
are
intended
to
form
the
basis
for
a
trade
and
employment
conference
to
be
held
in
the
middle
of
this
year
if
that
conference
is
a
success
i
feel
confident
that
the
way
will
have
been
adequately
prepared
for
an
expanded
and
prosperous
world
trade
we
shall
also
continue
negotiations
looking
to
the
full
and
equitable
development
of
facilities
for
transportation
and
communications
among
nations
the
vast
majority
of
the
nations
of
the
world
have
chosen
to
work
together
to
achieve
on
a
cooperative
basis
world
security
and
world
prosperity
the
effort
cannot
succeed
without
full
cooperation
of
the
united
states
to
play
our
part
we
must
not
only
resolutely
carry
out
the
foreign
policies
we
have
adopted
but
also
follow
a
domestic
policy
which
will
maintain
full
production
and
employment
in
the
united
states
a
serious
depression
here
can
disrupt
the
whole
fabric
of
the
world
economy
occupied
countries
the
major
tasks
of
our
military
establishment
in
europe
following
veday
and
in
the
pacific
since
the
surrender
of
japan
have
been
those
of
occupation
and
military
government
in
addition
we
have
given
much
needed
aid
to
the
peoples
of
the
liberated
countries
the
end
of
the
war
in
europe
found
germany
in
a
chaotic
condition
organized
government
had
ceased
to
exist
transportation
systems
had
been
wrecked
cities
and
industrial
facilities
had
been
bombed
into
ruins
in
addition
to
the
tasks
of
occupation
we
had
to
assume
all
of
the
functions
of
government
great
progress
has
been
made
in
the
repatriation
of
displaced
persons
and
of
prisoners
of
war
of
the
total
of
displaced
persons
found
in
the
united
states
zone
only
now
remain
the
extensive
complications
involved
by
the
requirement
of
dealing
with
three
other
governments
engaged
in
occupation
and
with
the
governments
of
liberated
countries
require
intensive
work
and
energetic
cooperation
the
influx
of
some
million
german
refugees
into
our

of

is
a
pressing
problem
making
exacting
demands
upon
an
already
overstrained
internal
economy
improvements
in
the
european
economy
during
have
made
it
possible
for
our

to
relinquish

the

of
all

or
to

relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
the
responsibility
for
the
provision
of

civilian
relief
supplies
the
armys
responsibilities
in
europe
extend
now
only
to
our
zones
of
occupation
in
germany
and
austria
and
to
two
small
areas
in
northern
italy
by
contrast
with
germany
in
japan
we
have
occupied
a
country
still
possessing
an
organized
and
operating
governmental
system
although
severely
damaged
the
japanese
industrial
and
transportation
systems
have
been
able
to
insure
at
least
a
survival
existence
for
the
population
the
repatriation
of
japanese
military
and
civilian
personnel
from
overseas
is
proceeding
as
rapidly
as
shipping
and
other
means
permit
in
order
to
insure
that
neither
germany
nor
japan
will
again
be
in
a
position
to
wage
aggressive
warfare
the
armament
making
potential
of
these
countries
is
being
dismantled
and
fundamental
changes
in
their
social
and
political
structures
are
being
effected
democratic
systems
are
being
fostered
to
the
end
that
the
voice
of
the
common
man
may
be
heard
in
the
councils
of
his
government
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
legal
culpability
of
war
makers
is
being
determined
the
trials
now
in
progress
in
nurnbergand
those
soon
to
begin
in
tokyobring
before
the
bar
of
international
justice
those
individuals
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
the
sufferings
of
the
past
six
years
we
have
high
hope
that
this
public
portrayal
of
the
guilt
of
these
evildoers
will
bring
wholesale
and
permanent
revulsion
on
the
part
of
the
masses
of
our
former
enemies
against
war
militarism
aggression
and
notions
of
race
superiority
demobilization
of
our
armed
forces
the
cessation
of
active
campaigning
does
not
mean
that
we
can
completely
disband
our
fighting
forces
for
their
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
their
loved
ones
at
home
i
wish
that
we
could
but
we
still
have
the
task
of
clinching
the
victories
we
have
wonof
making
certain
that
germany
and
japan
can
never
again
wage
aggressive
warfare
that
they
will
not
again
have
the
means
to
bring
on
another
world
war
the
performance
of
that
task
requires
that
together
with
our
allies
we
occupy
the
hostile
areas
complete
the
disarmament
of
our
enemies
and
take
the
necessary
measures
to
see
to
it
that
they
do
not
rearm
as
quickly
as
possible
we
are
bringing
about
the
reduction
of
our
armed
services
to
the
size
required
for
these
tasks
of
occupation
and
disarmament
the
army
and
the
navy
are
following
both
lengthofservice
and
point
systems
as
far
as
possible
in
releasing
men
and
women
from
the
service
the
points
are
based
chiefly
on
length
and
character
of
service
and
on
the
existence
of
dependents
over
million
from
the
army
have
already
passed
through
the
separation
centers
the
navy
including
the
marine
corps
and
the
coast
guard
has
discharged
over
one
and
a
half
million
of
the
million
men
and
women
serving
in
the
army
and
navy
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
of
germany
onehalf
have
already
been
released
the
greater
part
of
these
had
to
be
brought
back
to
this
country
from
distant
parts
of
the
world
of
course
there
are
cases
of
individual
hardship
in
retention
of
personnel
in
the
service
there
will
be
in
the
future
no
system
of
such
size
can
operate
to
perfection
but
the
systems
are
rounded
on
fairness
and
justice
and
they
are
working
at
full
speed
we
shall
try
to
avoid
mistakes
injustices
and
hardshipas
far
as
humanly
possible
we
have
already
reached
the
point
where
shipping
is
no
longer
the
bottleneck
in
the
return
of
troops
from
the
european
theater
the
governing
factor
now
has
become
the
requirement
for
troops
in
sufficient
strength
to
carry
out
their
missions
in
a
few
months
the
same
situation
will
exist
in
the
pacific
by
the
end
of
june
out
of
who
were
serving
in
the
armed
forces
on
veday
will
have
been
released
demobilization
will
continue
thereafter
but
at
a
slower
rate
determined
by
our
military
responsibilities
our
national
safety
and
the
security
of
the
world
will
require
substantial
armed
forces
particularly
in
overseas
service
at
the
same
time
it
is
imperative
that
we
relieve
those
who
have
already
done
their
duty
and
that
we
relieve
them
as
fast
as
we
can
to
do
that
the
army
and
the
navy
are
conducting
recruiting
drives
with
considerable
success
the
army
has
obtained
nearly
volunteers
in
the
past
four
months
and
the
navy
has
obtained
eighty
percent
of
these
volunteers
for
the
regular
service
have
come
from
those
already
with
the
colors
the
congress
has
made
it
possible
to
offer
valuable
inducements
to
those
who
are
eligible
for
enlistment
every
effort
will
be
made
to
enlist
the
required
number
of
young
men
the
war
and
navy
departments
now
estimate
that
by
a
year
from
now
we
still
will
need
a
strength
of
about
million
including
officers
for
the
armed
forcesarmy
navy
and
air
i
have
reviewed
their
estimates
and
believe
that
the
safety
of
the
nation
will
require
the
maintenance
of
an
armed
strength
of
this
size
for
the
calendar
year
that
is
before
us
in
case
the
campaign
for
volunteers
does
not
produce
that
number
it
will
be
necessary
by
additional
legislation
to
extend
the
selective
service
act
beyond
may
the
date
of
expiration
under
existing
law
that
is
the
only
way
we
can
get
the
men
and
bring
back
our
veterans
there
is
no
other
way
action
along
this
line
should
not
be
postponed
beyond
march
in
order
to
avoid
uncertainty
and
disruption
domestic
affairs
i
the
economic
outlook
prophets
of
doom
predicted
that
the
united
states
could
not
escape
a
runaway
inflation
during
the
war
and
an
economic
collapse
after
the
war
these
predictions
have
not
been
borne
out
on
the
contrary
the
record
of
economic
stabilization
during
the
war
and
during
the
period
of
reconversion
has
been
an
outstanding
accomplishment
we
know
however
that
nothing
is
as
dangerous
as
overconfidence
in
war
or
in
peace
we
have
had
to
fight
hard
to
hold
the
line
we
have
made
strenuous
efforts
to
speed
reconversion
but
neither
the
danger
of
a
postwar
inflation
nor
of
a
subsequent
collapse
in
production
and
employment
is
yet
overcome
we
must
base
our
policies
not
on
unreasoning
optimism
or
pessimism
but
upon
a
candid
recognition
of
our
objectives
and
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
foreseeable
trends
any
precise
appraisal
of
the
economic
outlook
at
this
time
is
particularly
difficult
the
period
of
demobilization
and
reconversion
is
fraught
with
uncertainties
there
are
also
serious
gaps
in
our
statistical
information
certain
tendencies
are
however
fairly
clear
and
recognition
of
them
should
serve
as
background
for
the
consideration
of
next
years
federal
program
in
general
the
outlook
for
business
is
good
and
it
is
likely
to
continue
to
be
goodprovided
we
control
inflation
and
achieve
peace
in
management
labor
relations
civilian
production
and
employment
can
be
expected
to
increase
throughout
the
next
year
this
does
not
mean
however
that
continuing
full
employment
is
assured
it
is
probable
that
demobilization
of
the
armed
forces
will
proceed
faster
than
the
increase
in
civilian
employment
opportunities
even
if
substantial
further
withdrawals
from
the
labor
market
occur
unemployment
will
increase
temporarily
the
extent
to
which
this
unemployment
will
persist
depends
largely
on
the
speed
of
industrial
expansion
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
along
with
extraordinary
demand
there
are
still
at
this
time
many
critical
shortages
resulting
from
the
war
these
extraordinary
demands
and
shortages
may
lead
to
a
speculative
boom
especially
in
the
price
of
securities
real
estate
and
inventories
therefore
our
chief
worry
still
is
inflation
while
we
control
this
inflationary
pressure
we
must
look
forward
to
the
time
when
this
extraordinary
demand
will
subside
it
will
be
years
before
we
catch
up
with
the
demand
for
housing
the
extraordinary
demand
for
other
durable
goods
for
the
replenishment
of
inventories
and
for
exports
may
be
satisfied
earlier
no
backlog
of
demand
can
exist
very
long
in
the
face
of
our
tremendous
productive
capacity
we
must
expect
again
to
face
the
problem
of
shrinking
demand
and
consequent
slackening
in
sales
production
and
employment
this
possibility
of
a
deflationary
spiral
in
the
future
will
exist
unless
we
now
plan
and
adopt
an
effective
full
employment
program
general
policiesimmediate
and
longrange
during
the
war
production
for
civilian
use
was
limited
by
war
needs
and
available
manpower
economic
stabilization
required
measures
to
spread
limited
supplies
equitably
by
rationing
price
controls
increased
taxes
savings
bond
campaigns
and
credit
controls
now
with
the
surrender
of
our
enemies
economic
stabilization
requires
that
policies
be
directed
toward
promoting
an
increase
in
supplies
at
low
unit
prices
we
must
encourage
the
development
of
resources
and
enterprises
in
all
parts
of
the
country
particularly
in
underdeveloped
areas
for
example
the
establishment
of
new
peacetime
industries
in
the
western
states
and
in
the
south
would
in
my
judgment
add
to
existing
production
and
markets
rather
than
merely
bring
about
a
shifting
of
production
i
am
asking
the
secretaries
of
agriculture
commerce
and
labor
to
explore
jointly
methods
for
stimulating
new
industries
particularly
in
areas
with
surplus
agricultural
labor
we
must
also
aid
small
businessmen
and
particularly
veterans
who
are
competent
to
start
their
own
businesses
the
establishment
and
development
of
efficient
small
business
ventures
i
believe
will
not
take
away
from
but
rather
will
add
to
the
total
business
of
all
enterprises
even
with
maximum
encouragement
of
production
we
cannot
hope
to
remove
scarcities
within
a
short
time
the
most
serious
deficiencies
will
persist
in
the
fields
of
residential
housing
building
materials
and
consumers
durable
goods
the
critical
situation
makes
continued
rent
control
price
control
and
priorities
allocations
and
inventory
controls
absolutely
essential
continued
control
of
consumer
credit
will
help
to
reduce
the
pressure
on
prices
of
durable
goods
and
will
also
prolong
the
period
during
which
the
backlog
demand
will
be
effective
while
we
are
meeting
these
immediate
needs
we
must
look
forward
to
a
longrange
program
of
security
and
increased
standard
of
living
the
best
protection
of
purchasing
power
is
a
policy
of
full
production
and
full
employment
opportunities
obviously
an
employed
worker
is
a
better
customer
than
an
unemployed
worker
there
always
will
be
however
some
frictional
unemployment
in
the
present
period
of
transition
we
must
deal
with
such
temporary
unemployment
as
results
from
the
fact
that
demobilization
will
proceed
faster
than
reconversion
or
industrial
expansion
such
temporary
unemployment
is
probably
unavoidable
in
a
period
of
rapid
change
the
unemployed
worker
is
a
victim
of
conditions
beyond
his
control
he
should
be
enabled
to
maintain
a
reasonable
standard
of
living
for
himself
and
his
family
the
most
serious
difficulty
in
the
path
of
reconversion
and
expansion
is
the
establishment
of
a
fair
wage
structure
the
ability
of
labor
and
management
to
work
together
and
the
wage
and
price
policies
which
they
develop
are
social
and
economic
issues
of
first
importance
both
labor
and
management
have
a
special
interest
labors
interest
is
very
direct
and
personal
because
working
conditions
wages
and
prices
affect
the
very
life
and
happiness
of
the
worker
and
his
family
management
has
a
no
less
direct
interest
because
on
management
rests
the
responsibility
for
conducting
a
growing
and
prosperous
business
but
management
and
labor
have
identical
interests
in
the
long
run
good
wages
mean
good
markets
good
business
means
more
jobs
and
better
wages
in
this
age
of
cooperation
and
in
our
highly
organized
economy
the
problems
of
one
very
soon
become
the
problems
of
all
better
human
relationships
are
an
urgent
need
to
which
organized
labor
and
management
should
address
themselves
no
government
policy
can
make
men
understand
each
other
agree
and
get
along
unless
they
conduct
themselves
in
a
way
to
foster
mutual
respect
and
good
will
the
government
can
however
help
to
develop
machinery
which
with
the
backing
of
public
opinion
will
assist
labor
and
management
to
resolve
their
disagreements
in
a
peaceful
manner
and
reduce
the
number
and
duration
of
strikes
all
of
us
realize
that
productivityincreased
output
per
manis
in
the
long
run
the
basis
of
our
standard
of
living
management
especially
must
realize
that
if
labor
is
to
work
wholeheartedly
for
an
increase
in
production
workers
must
be
given
a
just
share
of
increased
output
in
higher
wages
most
industries
and
most
companies
have
adequate
leeway
within
which
to
grant
substantial
wage
increases
these
increases
will
have
a
direct
effect
in
increasing
consumer
demand
to
the
high
levels
needed
substantial
wage
increases
are
good
business
for
business
because
they
assure
a
large
market
for
their
products
substantial
wage
increases
are
good
business
for
labor
because
they
increase
labors
standard
of
living
substantial
wage
increases
are
good
business
for
the
country
as
a
whole
because
capacity
production
means
an
active
healthy
friendly
citizenry
enjoying
the
benefits
of
democracy
under
our
free
enterprise
system
labor
and
management
in
many
industries
have
been
operating
successfully
under
the
governments
wageprice
policy
upward
revisions
of
wage
scales
have
been
made
in
thousands
of
establishments
throughout
the
nation
since
vjday
it
is
estimated
that
about
million
workers
or
more
than
percent
of
all
employees
in
nonagricultural
and
nongovernmental
establishments
have
received
wage
increases
since
august
the
amounts
of
increases
given
by
individual
employers
concentrate
between
and
percent
but
range
from
less
than
percent
to
over
percent
the
united
states
conciliation
service
since
vjday
has
settled
over
disputes
affecting
over
workers
without
a
strike
threat
and
has
assisted
in
settling
about
disputes
where
strikes
were
threatened
which
involved
about
workers
only
workers
directly
involved
and
not
those
in
related
industries
who
might
have
been
indirectly
affected
are
included
in
these
estimates
many
of
these
adjustments
have
occurred
in
key
industries
and
would
have
seemed
to
us
major
crises
if
they
had
not
been
settled
peaceably
within
the
framework
of
the
wageprice
policy
there
has
been
definite
success
and
it
is
to
be
expected
that
this
success
will
continue
in
a
vast
majority
of
the
cases
arising
in
the
months
ahead
however
everyone
who
realizes
the
extreme
need
for
a
swift
and
orderly
reconversion
must
feel
a
deep
concern
about
the
number
of
major
strikes
now
in
progress
if
long
continued
these
strikes
could
put
a
heavy
brake
on
our
program
i
have
already
made
recommendations
to
the
congress
as
to
the
procedure
best
adapted
to
meeting
the
threat
of
work
stoppages
in
nationwide
industries
without
sacrificing
the
fundamental
rights
of
labor
to
bargain
collectively
and
ultimately
to
strike
in
support
of
their
position
if
we
manage
our
economy
properly
the
future
will
see
us
on
a
level
of
production
half
again
as
high
as
anything
we
have
ever
accomplished
in
peacetime
business
can
in
the
future
pay
higher
wages
and
sell
for
lower
prices
than
ever
before
this
is
not
true
now
for
all
companies
nor
will
it
ever
be
true
for
all
but
for
business
generally
it
is
true
we
are
relying
on
all
concerned
to
develop
through
collective
bargaining
wage
structures
that
are
fair
to
labor
allow
for
necessary
business
incentives
and
conform
with
a
policy
designed
to
hold
the
line
on
prices
production
and
more
production
was
the
byword
during
the
war
and
still
is
during
the
transition
from
war
to
peace
however
when
deferred
demand
slackens
we
shall
once
again
face
the
deflationary
dangers
which
beset
this
and
other
countries
during
the
s
prosperity
can
be
assured
only
by
a
high
level
of
demand
supported
by
high
current
income
it
cannot
be
sustained
by
deferred
needs
and
use
of
accumulated
savings
if
we
take
the
right
steps
in
time
we
can
certainly
avoid
the
disastrous
excesses
of
runaway
booms
and
headlong
depressions
we
must
not
let
a
year
or
two
of
prosperity
lull
us
into
a
false
feeling
of
security
and
a
repetition
of
the
mistakes
of
the
s
that
culminated
in
the
crash
of
during
the
year
ahead
the
government
will
be
called
upon
to
act
in
many
important
fields
of
economic
policy
from
taxation
and
foreign
trade
to
social
security
and
housing
in
every
case
there
will
be
alternatives
we
must
choose
the
alternatives
which
will
best
measure
up
to
our
need
for
maintaining
production
and
employment
in
the
future
we
must
never
lose
sight
of
our
longterm
objectives
the
broadening
of
marketsthe
maintenance
of
steadily
rising
demand
this
demand
can
come
from
only
three
sources
consumers
businesses
or
government
in
this
country
the
job
of
production
and
distribution
is
in
the
hands
of
businessmen
farmers
workers
and
professional
peoplein
the
hands
of
our
citizens
we
want
to
keep
it
that
way
however
it
is
the
governments
responsibility
to
help
business
labor
and
farmers
do
their
jobs
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
government
acting
on
behalf
of
all
the
people
must
assume
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
economic
health
of
the
nation
there
is
no
other
agency
that
can
no
other
organization
has
the
scope
or
the
authority
nor
is
any
other
agency
accountable
to
all
the
people
this
does
not
mean
that
the
government
has
the
sole
responsibility
nor
that
it
can
do
the
job
alone
nor
that
it
can
do
the
job
directly
all
of
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
must
be
geared
to
the
objective
of
sustained
full
production
and
full
employmentto
raise
consumer
purchasing
power
and
to
encourage
business
investment
the
programs
we
adopt
this
year
and
from
now
on
will
determine
our
ability
to
achieve
our
objectives
we
must
continue
to
pay
particular
attention
to
our
fiscal

and
tax

we
have
at

we

in
a
way
to
encourage
consumer
spending
and
business
investment
or
to
discourage
ithave
a
vital
bearing
on
this
question
it
is
affected
also
by
regulations
on
consumer
credit
and
by
the
money
market
which
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
rate
of
interest
on

securities
it
is
affected
by
almost
every
step

take
in

proper

the
exercise
of
our
traditional
and
legitimate
governmental
functions
has
a
vital
bearing
on
the
economic
health
of
the

these
policies
are
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
the
accompanying
fifth
quarterly
report
of
the
director
of
war
mobilization
and
reconversion
legislation
heretofore
recommended
and
still
pending

attain
some
of
these
objectives
and
to
meet
the
other
needs
of
the
united
states
in
the
reconversion
and
postwar
period
i
have
from
time
to
time
made
various
recommendations
to
the
congress
in
making
these
recommendations
i
have
indicated
the
reasons
why
i
deemed
them
essential

act
today
inflation
is
our
greatest
immediate
domestic
problem
so
far
the
fight
against
inflation
has
been
waged
successfully
since
may
following
president
roosevelts
hold
the
line
order
and
in
the
face
of
the
greatest
pressures
which
this
country
has
ever
seen
the
cost
of
living
index
has
risen
only
three
percent
wholesale
prices
in
this
same
period
have
been
held
to
an
increase
of
two
and
onehalf
percent
this
record
has
been
made
possible
by
the
vigorous
efforts
of
the
agencies
responsible
for
this
program
but
their
efforts
would
have
been
fruitless
if
they
had
not
had
the
solid
support
of
the
great
masses
of
our
people
the
congress
is
to
be
congratulated
for
its
role
in
providing
the
legislation
under
which
this
work
has
been
carried
out
on
vjday
it
was
clear
to
all
thinking
people
that
the
danger
of
inflation
was
by
no
means
over
many
of
us
can
remember
vividly
our
disastrous
experience
following
world
war
i
then
the
very
restricted
wartime
controls
were
lifted
too
quickly
and
as
a
result
prices
and
rents
moved
more
rapidly
upward
in
the
year
and
a
half
following
the
armistice
rents
food
and
clothing
shot
to
higher
and
still
higher
levels
when
the
inevitable
crash
occurred
less
than
two
years
after
the
end
of
the
war
business
bankruptcies
were
widespread
profits
were
wiped
out
inventory
losses
amounted
to
billions
of
dollars
farm
income
dropped
by
onehalf
factory
pay
rolls
dropped
percent
and
nearly
onefifth
of
all
our
industrial
workers
were
walking
the
streets
in
search
of
jobs
this
was
a
grim
greeting
indeed
to
offer
our
veterans
who
had
just
returned
from
overseas
when
i
addressed
the
congress
in
september
i
emphasized
that
we
must
continue
to
hold
the
price
line
until
the
production
of
goods
caught
up
with
the
tremendous
demands
since
then
we
have
seen
demonstrated
the
strength
of
the
inflationary
pressures
which
we
have
to
face
retail
sales
in
the
closing
months
of
ran
percent
above
the
previous
peak
for
that
season
which
came
in
prices
throughout
the
entire
economy
have
been
pressing
hard
against
the
price
ceilings
the
prices
of
real
estate
which
cannot
now
be
controlled
under
the
law
are
rising
rapidly
commercial
rents
are
not
included
in
the
present
price
control
law
and
where
they
are
not
controlled
by
state
law
have
been
increasing
causing
difficulties
to
many
businessmen
it
will
be
impossible
to
maintain
a
high
purchasing
power
or
an
expanding
production
unless
we
can
keep
prices
at
levels
which
can
be
met
by
the
vast
majority
of
our
people
full
production
is
the
greatest
weapon
against
inflation
but
until
we
can
produce
enough
goods
to
meet
the
threat
of
inflation
the
government
will
have
to
exercise
its
wartime
control
over
prices
i
am
sure
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
disturbed
by
the
demands
made
by
several
business
groups
with
regard
to
price
and
rent
control
i
am
particularly
disturbed
at
the
effect
such
thinking
may
have
on
production
and
employment
if
manufacturers
continue
to
hold
back
goods
and
decline
to
submit
bids
when
invitedas
i
am
informed
some
are
doingin
anticipation
of
higher
prices
which
would
follow
the
end
of
price
controls
we
shall
inevitably
slow
down
production
and
create
needless
unemployment
on
the
other
hand
there
are
the
vast
majority
of
american
businessmen
who
are
not
holding
back
goods
but
who
need
certainty
about
the
government
pricing
policy
in
order
to
fix
their
own
longrange
pricing
policies
businessmen
are
entitled
therefore
to
a
dear
statement
of
the
policy
of
the
government
on
the
subject
tenants
and
housewives
farmers
and
workersconsumers
in
generalhave
an
equal
right
we
are
all
anxious
to
eliminate
unnecessary
controls
just
as
rapidly
as
we
can
do
so
the
steps
that
we
have
already
taken
in
many
directions
toward
that
end
are
a
clear
indication
of
our
policy
the
present
price
control
act
expires
on
june
if
we
expect
to
maintain
a
steady
economy
we
shall
have
to
maintain
price
and
rent
control
for
many
months
to
come
the
inflationary
pressures
on
prices
and
rents
with
relatively
few
exceptions
are
now
at
an
alltime
peak
unless
the
price
control
act
is
renewed
there
will
be
no
limit
to
which
our
price
levels
would
soar
our
country
would
face
a
national
disaster
we
cannot
wait
to
renew
the
act
until
immediately
before
it
expires
inflation
results
from
psychological
as
well
as
economic
conditions
the
country
has
a
clear
right
to
know
where
the
congress
stands
on
this
allimportant
problem
any
uncertainty
now
as
to
whether
the
act
will
be
extended
gives
rise
to
price
speculation
to
withholding
of
goods
from
the
market
in
anticipation
of
rising
prices
and
to
delays
in
achieving
maximum
production
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
congress
will
be
beset
by
many
groups
who
will
urge
that
the
legislation
that
i
have
proposed
should
either
be
eliminated
or
modified
to
the
point
where
it
is
nearly
useless
the
congress
has
a
clear
responsibility
to
meet
this
challenge
with
courage
and
determination
i
have
every
confidence
that
it
will
do
so
i
strongly
urge
that
the
congress
now
resolve
all
doubts
and
as
soon
as
possible
adopt
legislation
continuing
rent
and
price
control
in
effect
for
a
full
year
from
june
b
food
subsidies
if
the
price
line
is
to
be
held
if
our
people
are
to
be
protected
against
the
inflationary
dangers
which
confront
us
we
must
do
more
than
extend
the
price
control
act
in
september
we
were
hopeful
that
the
inflationary
pressures
would
by
this
time
have
begun
to
diminish
we
were
particularly
hopeful
on
food
indeed
it
was
estimated
that
food
prices
at
retail
would
drop
from
to
percent
in
the
first
six
months
following
the
end
of
the
war
in
anticipation
of
this
decline
in
food
prices
it
was
our
belief
that
food
subsidies
could
be
removed
gradually
during
the
winter
and
spring
months
and
eliminated
almost
completely
by
june
of
this
year
it
was
our
feeling
that
the
food
subsidies
could
be
dropped
without
an
increase
to
the
consumer
in
the
present
level
of
food
prices
or
in
the
overall
cost
of
living
as
matters
stand
today
however
food
prices
are
pressing
hard
against
the
ceilings
the
expected
decline
in
food
prices
has
not
occurred
nor
is
it
likely
to
occur
for
many
months
to
come
this
brings
me
to
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
food
subsidies
must
be
continued
beyond
june
if
we
fail
to
take
this
necessary
step
meat
prices
on
july
will
be
from
to
cents
higher
than
their
average
present
levels
butter
will
be
at
least
cents
a
pound
higher
in
addition
to
the
cents
a
pound
increase
of
last
fall
milk
will
increase
from
to
cents
a
quart
bread
will
increase
about
cent
a
loaf
sugar
will
increase
over
cent
a
pound
cheese
in
addition
to
the
increase
of
cents
now
planned
for
the
latter
part
of
this
month
will
go
up
an
additional
cents
in
terms
of
percentages
we
may
find
the
costofliving
index
for
food
increased
by
more
than
percent
which
in
turn
would
result
in
more
than
a
percent
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
if
prices
of
food
were
allowed
to
increase
by
these
amounts
i
must
make
it
clear
to
the
congress
that
in
my
opinion
it
would
become
extremely
difficult
for
us
to
control
the
forces
of
inflation
none
of
us
likes
subsidies
our
farmers
in
particular
have
always
been
opposed
to
them
but
i
believe
our
farmers
are
as
deeply
conscious
as
any
group
in
the
land
of
the
havoc
which
inflation
can
create
certainly
in
the
past
eighteen
months
there
has
been
no
group
which
has
fought
any
harder
in
support
of
the
governments
price
control
program
i
am
confident
that
if
the
facts
are
placed
before
them
and
if
they
see
clearly
the
evils
between
which
we
are
forced
to
choose
they
will
understand
the
reasons
why
subsidies
must
be
continued
the
legislation
continuing
the
use
of
food
subsidies
into
the
new
fiscal
year
should
be
tied
down
specifically
to
certain
standards
a
very
proper
requirement
in
my
opinion
would
be
that
subsidies
be
removed
as
soon
as
it
is
indicated
that
the
cost
of
living
will
decline
below
the
present
levels
c
extension
of
war
powers
act
the
second
war
powers
act
has
recently
been
extended
by
the
congress
for
six
months
instead
of
for
a
year
it
will
now
expire
unless
further
extended
on
june
this
act
is
the
basis
for
priority
and
inventory
controls
governing
the
use
of
scarce
materials
as
well
as
for
other
powers
essential
to
orderly
reconversion
i
think
that
this
administration
has
given
adequate
proof
of
the
fact
that
it
desires
to
eliminate
wartime
controls
as
quickly
and
as
expeditiously
as
possible
however
we
know
that
there
will
continue
to
be
shortages
of
certain
materials
caused
by
the
war
even
after
june
it
is
important
that
businessmen
know
now
that
materials
in
short
supply
are
going
to
be
controlled
and
distributed
fairly
as
long
as
these
warborn
shortages
continue
i
therefore
urge
the
congress
soon
to
extend
the
second
war
powers
act
we
cannot
afford
to
wait
until
just
before
the
act
expires
next
june
to
wait
would
cause
the
controls
to
break
down
in
a
short
time
and
would
hamper
our
production
and
employment
program
d
small
business
and
competition
a
rising
birth
rate
for
small
business
and
a
favorable
environment
for
its
growth
are
not
only
economic
necessities
but
also
important
practical
demonstrations
of
opportunity
in
a
democratic
free
society
a
great
many
veterans
and
workers
with
new
skills
and
experience
will
want
to
start
in
for
themselves
the
opportunity
must
be
afforded
them
to
do
so
they
are
the
small
businessmen
of
the
future
actually
when
we
talk
about
small
business
we
are
talking
about
almost
all
of
the
nations
individual
businesses
nine
out
of
every
ten
concerns
fall
into
this
category
and
percent
of
all
workers
are
employed
by
them
between
and
percent
of
the
total
value
of
all
business
transactions
are
handled
by
small
business
it
is
obvious
national
policy
to
foster
the
sound
development
of
small
business
it
helps
to
maintain
high
levels
of
employment
and
national
income
and
consumption
of
the
goods
and
services
that
the
nation
can
produce
it
encourages
the
competition
that
keeps
our
free
enterprise
economy
vigorous
and
expanding
small
business
because
of
its
flexibility
assists
in
the
rapid
exploitation
of
scientific
and
technological
discoveries
investment
in
small
business
can
absorb
a
large
volume
of
savings
that
might
otherwise
not
be
tapped
the
government
should
encourage
and
is
encouraging
smallbusiness
initiative
and
originality
to
stimulate
progress
through
competition
during
the
war
the
smaller

the

we

a

of
our

it
is
competition
that
keeps
it
free
it
is
competition
that
keeps
it
growing

developing
the
truth
is
that
we
need
far
more
competition
in
the

than
we
have
had
in
the
immediate
past

strangling
competition
monopolistic

the
federal

must

from

by

during

enforcement
of

the

must
now
take
major
steps
not
only
to
maintain
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws
but
to
encourage
new
and
competing
enterprises
in
every
way
the
deferred
demand
of
the
war
years
and
the
large
accumulations
of
liquid

provide
ample
incentive
for
expansion
equalizing
of
business
opportunity
under
full
and
free
competition
must
be
a
prime
responsibility
in
the
reconversion
period
and
in
the
years
that
follow
many
leading
businessmen
have
recognized
the
importance
of
such
action
both
to
themselves
and
to
the
economy
as
a
whole
but
we
must
do
more
than
break
up
trusts
and
monopolies
after
they
have
begun
to
strangle
competition
we
must
take
positive
action
to
foster
new
expanding
enterprises
by
legislation
and
by
administration
we
must
take
specific
steps
to
discourage
the
formation
or
the
strengthening
of
competitionrestricting
business
we
must
have
an
overall
antimonopoly
policy
which
can
be
applied
by
all
agencies
of
the
government
in
exercising
the
functions
assigned
to
thema
policy
designed
to
encourage
the
formation
and
growth
of
new
and
freely
competitive
enterprises
among
the
many
departments
and
agencies
which
have
parts
in
the
program
affecting
business
and
competition
the
department
of
commerce
has
a
particularly
important
role
that
is
why
i
have
recommended
a
substantial
increase
in
appropriations
for
the
next
fiscal
year
for
this
department
in
its
assistance
to
industry
the
department
of
commerce
will
concentrate
its
efforts
on
these
primary
objectives
promotion
of
a
large
and
wellbalanced
foreign
trade
provision
of
improved
technical
assistance
and
management
aids
especially
for
small

and
strengthening
of
basic

and
by

to
make
new

and

available
more
promptly
to

the

proposes
to
expand
its
own
research
activities
promote

improve
patent
office
procedures
and
develop
a
greatly
expanded
system
of
field
offices
readily
accessible
to

they
serve
many
gaps
exist
in
the
private
financial
mechanism
especially
in
the
provision
of
longterm
funds
for
small
and
medium
sized
enterprises
in
the
peacetime
economy
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
will
take
the
leadership
in
assuring
adequate
financing
for
small
enterprises
which
cannot
secure
funds
from
other
sources
most
of
the
funds
should
and
will
be
provided
by
private
lenders
but
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
will
share
any
unusual
risks
through
guarantees
of
private
loans
with
direct
loans
only
when
private
capital
is
unwilling
to
participate
on
a
reasonable
basis
e
minimum
wage
full
employment
and
full
production
may
be
achieved
only
by
maintaining
a
level
of
consumer
income
far
higher
than
that
of
the
prewar
period
a
high
level
of
consumer
income
will
maintain
the
market
for
the
output
of
our
mills
farms
and
factories
which
we
have
demonstrated
during
the
war
years
that
we
can
produce
one
of
the
basic
steps
which
the
congress
can
take
to
establish
a
high
level
of
consumer
income
is
to
amend
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
raise
substandard
wages
to
a
decent
minimum
and
to
extend
similar
protection
to
additional
workers
who
are
not
covered
by
the
present
act
substandard
wages
are
bad
for
business
and
for
the
farmer
substandard
wages
provide
only
a
substandard
market
for
the
goods
and
services
produced
by
american
industry
and
agriculture
at
the
present
time
the
fair
labor
standards
act
prescribes
a
minimum
wage
of
cents
an
hour
for
those
workers
who
are
covered
by
the
act
the
present
minimum
wage
represents
an
annual
income
of
about
to
those
continuously
employed
for
weeksclearly
a
wholly
inadequate
budget
for
an
american
family
i
am
in
full
accord
with
the
proposal
now
pending
in
the
congress
that
the
statutory
minimum
be
raised
immediately
to
cents
an
hour
with
further
increases
to
cents
after
one
year
and
to
cents
after
two
years
i
also
favor
the
proposal
that
the
industry
committee
procedure
be
used
to
set
rates
higher
than
cents
per
hour
during
the
twoyear
interval
before
the
cent
basic
wage
would
otherwise
become
applicable
the
proposed
minimum
wage
of
cents
an
hour
would
assure
the
worker
an
annual
income
of
about
a
year
in
steady
employment
this
amount
is
clearly
a
modest
goal
after
considering
costofliving
increases
in
recent
years
it
is
little
more
than
a
cent
increase
over
the
present
legal
minimum
in
fact
if
any
large
number
of
workers
earn
less
than
this
amount
we
will
find
it
impossible
to
maintain
the
levels
of
purchasing
power
needed
to
sustain
the
stable
prosperity
which
we
desire
raising
the
minimum
to
cents
an
hour
will
provide
the
wage
earner
with
an
annual
income
of
if
he
is
fully
employed
the
proposed
higher
minimum
wage
levels
are
feasible
without
involving
serious
price
adjustments
or
serious
geographic
dislocations
today
about
percent
of
our
manufacturing
wage
earnersor
about
millionearn
less
than
cents
an
hour
because
wages
in
most
industries
have
risen
during
the
war
this
is
about
the
same
as
the
proportion
percentwho
were
earning
less
than
cents
an
hour
in
i
also
recommend
that
minimum
wage
protection
be
extended
to
several
groups
of
workers
not
now
covered
the
need
for
a
decent
standard
of
living
is
by
no
means
limited
to
those
workers
who
happen
to
be
covered
by
the
act
as
it
now
stands
it
is
particularly
vital
at
this
period
of
readjustment
in
the
national
economy
and
readjustment
in
employment
of
labor
to
extend
minimum
wage
protection
as
far
as
possible
lifting
the
basic
minimum
wage
is
necessary
it
is
justified
as
a
matter
of
simple
equity
to
workers
and
it
will
prove
not
only
feasible
but
also
directly
beneficial
to
the
nations
employers
f
agricultural
programs
the
farmers
of
america
generally
are
entering
the
crop
year
of
in
better
financial
condition
than
ever
before
farm
mortgage
debt
is
the
lowest
in
years
farmers
savings
are
the
largest
in
history
our
agricultural
plant
is
in
much
better
condition
than
after
world
war
i
farm
machinery
and
supplies
are
expected
to
be
available
in
larger
volume
and
farm
labor
problems
will
be
less
acute
the
demand
for
farm
products
will
continue
strong
during
the
next
year
or
two
because
domestic
purchases
will
be
supplemented
by
a
high
level
of
exports
and
foreign
relief
shipments
it
is
currently
estimated
that
from
to
percent
of
the
total
united
states
food
supply
may
be
exported
in
the
calendar
year
farm
prices
are
expected
to
remain
at
least
at
their
present
levels
in
the
immediate
future
and
for
at
least
the
next
months
they
are
expected
to
yield
a
net
farm
income
double
the
average
and
higher
than
in
any
year
prior
to
we
can
look
to
the
future
of
agriculture
with
greater
confidence
than
in
many
a
year
in
the
past
agriculture
itself
is
moving
confidently
ahead
planning
for
another
year
of
big
production
taking
definite
and
positive
steps
to
lead
the
way
toward
an
economy
of
abundance
agricultural
production
goals
for
call
for
somewhat
greater
acreage
than
actually
was
planted
in
agriculture
is
prepared
to
demonstrate
that
it
can
make
a
peacetime
contribution
as
great
as
its
contribution
toward
the
winning
of
the
war
in
spite
of
supplying
our
armed
forces
and
our
allies
during
the
war
with
a
fifth
to
a
fourth
of
our
total
food
output
farmers
were
still
able
to
provide
our
civilians
with
percent
more
food
per
capita
than
the
average
for
the
five
years
preceding
the
war
since
the
surrender
of
japan
civilian
food
consumption
has
risen
still
further
by
the
end
of
the
amount
of
the
increase
in
food
consumption
was
estimated
to
be
as
high
as
percent
over
the
prewar
average
the
record
shows
that
the
people
of
this
country
want
and
need
more
food
and
that
they
will
buy
more
food
if
only
they
have
the
jobs
and
the
purchasing
power
the
first
essential
therefore
in
providing
fully
for
the
welfare
of
agriculture
is
to
maintain
full
employment
and
a
high
level
of
purchasing
power
throughout
the
nation
for
the
period
immediately
ahead
we
shall
still
have
the
problem
of
supplying
enough
food
if
we
are
to
do
our
part
in
aiding
the
warstricken
and
starving
countries
some
of
the
food
desires
of
our
own
people
will
not
be
completely
satisfied
at
least
until
these
nations
have
had
an
opportunity
to
harvest
another
crop
during
the
next
few
months
the
need
for
food
in
the
world
will
be
more
serious
than
at
any
time
during
the
war
and
despite
the
large
shipments
we
have
already
made
and
despite
what
we
shall
send
there
remain
great
needs
abroad
beyond
the
relief
feeding
period
there
will
still
be
substantial
foreign
outlets
for
our
farm
commodities
the
chief
dependence
of
the
farmer
however
as
always
must
be
upon
the
buying
power
of
our
own
people
the
first
obligation
of
the
government
to
agriculture
for
the
reconversion
period
is
to
make
good
on
its
pricesupport
commitments
this
we
intend
to
do
with
realistic
consideration
for
the
sound
patterns
of
production
that
will
contribute
most
to
the
longtime
welfare
of
agriculture
and
the
whole
nation
the
period
during
which
prices
are
supported
will
provide
an
opportunity
for
farmers
individually
to
strengthen
their
position
in
changing
over
from
a
wartime
to
a
peacetime
basis
of
production
it
will
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
congress
to
review
the
needs
of
agriculture
and
make
changes
in
national
legislation
where
experience
has
shown
changes
to
be
needed
in
this
connection
the
congress
will
wish
to
consider
legislation
to
take
the
place
of
the
sugar
act
which
expires
at
the
end
of
this
year
during
this
period
we
must
do
a
thorough
job
of
basic
planning
to
the
end
that
agriculture
shall
be
able
to
contribute
its
full
share
toward
a
healthy
national
economy
our
longrange
agricultural
policies
should
have
two
main
objectives
first
to
assure
the
people
on
the
farms
a
fair
share
of
the
national
income
and
second
to
encourage
an
agricultural
production
pattern
that
is
best
fitted
to
the
nations
needs
to
accomplish
this
second
objective
we
shall
have
to
take
into
consideration
changes
that
have
taken
place
and
will
continue
to
take
place
in
the
production
of
farm
commoditieschanges
that
affect
costs
and
efficiency
and
volume
what
we
seek
ultimately
is
a
high
level
of
food
production
and
consumption
that
will
provide
good
nutrition
for
everyone
this
cannot
be
accomplished
by
agriculture
alone
we
can
be
certain
of
our
capacity
to
produce
food
but
we
have
often
failed
to
distribute
it
as
well
as
we
should
and
to
see
that
our
people
can
afford
to
buy
it
the
way
to
get
good
nutrition
for
the
whole
nation
is
to
provide
employment
opportunities
and
purchasing
power
for
all
groups
that
will
enable
them
to
buy
full
diets
at
market
prices
wherever
purchasing
power
fails
to
reach
this
level
we
should
see
that
they
have
some
means
of
getting
adequate
food
at
prices
in
line
with
their
ability
to
buy
therefore
we
should
have
available
supplementary
programs
that
will
enable
all
our
people
to
have
enough
of
the
right
kind
of
food
for
example
one
of
the
best
possible
contributions
toward
building
a
stronger
healthier
nation
would
be
a
permanent
schoollunch
program
on
a
scale
adequate
to
assure
every
school
child
a
good
lunch
at
noon
the
congress
of
course
has
recognized
this
need
for
a
continuing
schoollunch
program
and
legislation
to
that
effect
has
been
introduced
and
hearings
held
the
plan
contemplates
the
attainment
of
this
objective
with
a
minimum
of
federal
expenditures
i
hope
that
the
legislation
will
be
enacted
in
time
for
a
permanent
program
to
start
with
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
next
fall
we
have
the
technical
knowledge
and
the
productive
capacity
to
provide
plenty
of
good
food
for
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
united
states
it
is
time
we
made
that
possibility
a
reality
g
resource
development
the
strength
of
our
nation
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
rest
upon
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
we
have
learned
that
proper
conservation
of
our
lands
including
our
forests
and
minerals
and
wise
management
of
our
waters
will
add
immensely
to
our
national
wealth
the
first
step
in
the
governments
conservation
program
must
be
to
find
out
just
what
are
our
basic
resources
and
how
they
should
be
used
we
need
to
take
as
soon
as
possible
an
inventory
of
the
lands
the
minerals
and
the
forests
of
the
nation
during
the
war
it
was
necessary
to
curtail
some
of
our
longrange
plans
for
development
of
our
natural
resources
and
to
emphasize
programs
vital
to
the
prosecution
of
the
war
work
was
suspended
on
a
number
of
flood
control
and
reclamation
projects
and
on
the
development
of
our
national
forests
and
parks
this
work
must
now
be
resumed
and
new
projects
must
be
undertaken
to
provide
essential
services
and
to
assist
in
the
process
of
economic
development
the
rivers
of
america
offer
a
great
opportunity
to
our
generation
in
the
management
of
the
national
wealth
by
a
wise
use
of
federal
funds
most
of
which
will
be
repaid
into
the
treasury
the
scourge
of
floods
and
drought
can
be
curbed
water
can
be
brought
to
arid
lands
navigation
can
be
extended
and
cheap
power
can
be
brought
alike
to
the
farms
and
to
the
industries
of
our
land
through
the
use
of
the
waters
of
the
columbia
river
for
example
we
are
creating
a
rich
agricultural
area
as
large
as
the
state
of
delaware
at
the
same
time
we
are
producing
power
at
grand
coulee
and
at
bonneville
which
played
a
mighty
part
in
winning
the
war
and
which
will
found
a
great
peacetime
industry
in
the
northwest
the
tennessee
valley
authority
will
resume
its
peacetime
program
of
promoting
full
use
of
the
resources
of
the
valley
we
shall
continue
our
plans
for
the
development
of
the
missouri
valley
the
arkansas
valley
and
the
central
valley
of
california
the
congress
has
shown
itself
alive
to
the
practical
requirements
for
a
beneficial
use
of
our
water
resources
by
providing
that
preference
in
the
sale
of
power
be
given
to
farmers
cooperatives
and
public
agencies
the
public
power
program
thus
authorized
must
continue
to
be
made
effective
by
building
the
necessary
generating
and
transmission
facilities
to
furnish
the
maximum
of
firm
power
needed
at
the
wholesale
markets
which
are
often
distant
from
the
dam
sites
these
great
developmental
projects
will
open
the
frontiers
of
agriculture
industry
and
commerce
the
employment
opportunities
thus
offered
will
also
go
far
to
ease
the
transition
from
war
to
peace
h
public
works
during
the
war
even
urgently
needed
federal
state
and
local
construction
projects
were
deferred
in
order
to
release
sources
for
war
production
in
resuming
public
works
construction
it
is
desirable
to
proceed
only
at
a
moderate
rate
since
demand
for
private
construction
will
be
abnormally
high
for
some
time
our
public
works
program
should
be
timed
to
reach
its
peak
after
demand
for
private
construction
has
begun
to
taper
off
meanwhile
however
plans
should
be
prepared
if
we
are
to
act
promptly
when
the
present
extraordinary
private
demand
begins
to
run
out
the
congress
made
money
available
to
federal
agencies
for
their
public
works
planning
in
the
fiscal
year
i
strongly
recommend
that
this
policy
be
continued
and
extended
in
the
fiscal
year
state
and
local
governments
also
have
an
essential
role
to
play
in
a
national
public
works
program
in
my
message
of
september
i
recommended
that
the
congress
vote
such
grants
to
state
and
local
governments
as
will
insure
that
each
level
of
government
makes
its
proper
contribution
to
a
balanced
public
construction
program
specifically
the
federal
government
should
aid
state
and
local
governments
in
planning
their
own
public
works
programs
in
undertaking
projects
related
to
federal
programs
of
regional
development
and
in
constructing
such
public
works
as
are
necessary
to
carry
out
the
various
policies
of
the
federal
government
early
in
the
congress
made
available
advances
to
state
and
local
governments
for
planning
public
works
projects
and
recently
made
additional
provision
to
continue
these
advances
through
the
fiscal
year
i
believe
that
further
appropriations
will
be
needed
for
the
same
purpose
for
the
fiscal
year
the
congress
has
already
made
provision
for
highway
programs
it
is
now
considering
legislation
which
would
expand
federal
grants
and
loans
in
several
other
fields
including
construction
of
airports
hospital
and
health
centers
housing
water
pollution
control
facilities
and
educational
plant
facilities
i
hope
that
early
action
will
be
taken
to
authorize
these
federal
programs
with
respect
to
public
works
of
strictly
local
importance
state
and
local
governments
should
proceed
without
federal
assistance
except
in
planning
this
rule
should
be
subject
to
review
when
and
if
the
prospect
of
highly
adverse
general
economic
developments
warrants
it
all
loans
and
grants
for
public
works
should
be
planned
and
administered
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
brought
into
accord
with
the
other
elements
of
the
federal
program
our
longrun
objective
is
to
achieve
a
program
of
direct
federal
and
federally
assisted
public
works
which
is
planned
in
advance
and
synchronized
with
business
conditions
in
this
way
it
can
make
its
greatest
contribution
to
general
economic
stability
national
housing
program
last
september
i
stated
in
my
message
to
the
congress
that
housing
was
high
on
the
list
of
matters
calling
for
decisive
action
since
then
the
housing
shortage
in
countless
communities
affecting
millions
of
families
has
magnified
this
call
to
action
today
we
face
both
an
immediate
emergency
and
a
major
postwar
problem
since
vjday
the
wartime
housing
shortage
has
been
growing
steadily
worse
and
pressure
on
real
estate
values
has
increased
returning
veterans
often
cannot
find
a
satisfactory
place
for
their
families
to
live
and
many
who
buy
have
to
pay
exorbitant
prices
rapid
demobilization
inevitably
means
further
overcrowding
a
realistic
and
practical
attack
on
the
emergency
will
require
aggressive
action
by
local
governments
with
federal
aid
to
exploit
all
opportunities
and
to
give
the
veterans
as
far
as
possible
first
chance
at
vacancies
it
will
require
continuation
of
rent
control
in
shortage
areas
as
well
as
legislation
to
permit
control
of
sales
prices
it
will
require
maximum
conversion
of
temporary
war
units
for
veterans
housing
and
their
transportation
to
communities
with
the
most
pressing
needs
the
congress
has
already
appropriated
funds
for
this
purpose
the
inflation
in
the
price
of
housing
is
growing
daily
as
a
result
of
the
housing
shortage
it
is
inevitable
that
the
present
dangers
of
inflation
in
home
values
will
continue
unless
the
congress
takes
action
in
the
immediate
future
legislation
is
now
pending
in
the
congress
which
would
provide
for
ceiling
prices
for
old
and
new
houses
the
authority
to
fix
such
ceilings
is
essential
with
such
authority
our
veterans
and
other
prospective
home
owners
would
be
protected
against
a
skyrocketing
of
home
prices
the
country
would
be
protected
from
the
extension
of
the
present
inflation
in
home
values
which
if
allowed
to
continue
will
threaten
not
only
the
stabilization
program
but
our
opportunities
for
attaining
a
sustained
high
level
of
home
construction
such
measures
are
necessary
stopgapsbut
only
stopgaps
this
emergency
action
taken
alone
is
goodbut
not
enough
the
housing
shortage
did
not
start
with
the
war
or
with
demobilization
it
began
years
before
that
and
has
steadily
accumulated
the
speed
with
which
the
congress
establishes
the
foundation
for
a
permanent
longrange
housing
program
will
determine
how
effectively
we
grasp
the
immense
opportunity
to
achieve
our
goal
of
decent
housing
and
to
make
housing
a
major
instrument
of
continuing
prosperity
and
full
employment
in
the
years
ahead
it
will
determine
whether
we
move
forward
to
a
stable
and
healthy
housing
enterprise
and
toward
providing
a
decent
home
for
every
american
family
production
is
the
only
fully
effective
answer
to
get
the
wheels
turning
i
have
appointed
an
emergency
housing
expediter
i
have
approved
establishment
of
priorities
designed
to
assure
an
ample
share
of
scarce
materials
to
builders
of
houses
for
which
veterans
will
have
preference
additional
price
and
wage
adjustments
will
be
made
where
necessary
and
other
steps
will
be
taken
to
stimulate
greater
production
of
bottleneck
items
i
recommend
consideration
of
every
sound
method
for
expansion
in
facilities
for
insurance
of
privately
financed
housing
by
the
federal
housing
administration
and
resumption
of
previously
authorized
lowrent
public
housing
projects
suspended
during
the
war
in
order
to
meet
as
many
demands
of
the
emergency
situation
as
possible
a
program
of
emergency
measures
is
now
being
formulated
for
action
these
will
include
steps
in
addition
to
those
already
taken
as
quickly
as
this
program
can
be
formulated
announcement
will
be
made
last
september
i
also
outlined
to
the
congress
the
basic
principles
for
the
kind
of
decisive
permanent
legislation
necessary
for
a
longrange
housing
program
these
principles
place
paramount
the
fact
that
housing
construction
and
financing
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
citizens
should
be
done
by
private
enterprise
they
contemplate
also
that
we
afford
governmental
encouragement
to
privately
financed
house
construction
for
families
of
moderate
income
through
extension
of
the
successful
system
of
insurance
of
housing
investment
that
research
be
undertaken
to
develop
better
and
cheaper
methods
of
building
homes
that
communities
be
assisted
in
appraising
their
housing
needs
that
we
commence
a
program
of
federal
aid
with
fair
local
participation
to
stimulate
and
promote
the
rebuilding
and
redevelopment
of
slums
and
blighted
areaswith
maximum
use
of
private
capital
it
is
equally
essential
that
we
use
public
funds
to
assist
families
of
low
income
who
could
not
otherwise
enjoy
adequate
housing
and
that
we
quicken
our
rate
of
progress
in
rural
housing
legislation
now
under
consideration
by
the
congress
provides
for
a
comprehensive
attack
jointly
by
private
enterprise
state
and
local
authorities
and
the
federal
government
this
legislation
would
make
permanent
the
national
housing
agency
and
give
it
authority
and
funds
for
much
needed
technical
and
economic
research
it
would
provide
additional
stimulus
for
privately
financed
housing
construction
this
stimulus
consists
of
establishing
a
new
system
of
yield
insurance
to
encourage
largescale
investment
in
rental
housing
and
broadening
the
insuring
powers
of
the
federal
housing
administration
and
the
lending
powers
of
the
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
where
private
industry
cannot
build
the
government
must
step
in
to
do
the
job
the
bill
would
encourage
expansion
in
housing
available
for
the
lowest
income
groups
by
continuing
to
provide
direct
subsidies
for
lowrent
housing
and
rural
housing
it
would
facilitate
land
assembly
for
urban
redevelopment
by
loans
and
contributions
to
local
public
agencies
where
the
localities
do
their
share
prompt
enactment
of
permanent
housing
legislation
along
these
lines
will
not
interfere
with
the
emergency
action
already
under
way
on
the
contrary
it
would
lift
us
out
of
a
potentially
perpetual
state
of
housing
emergency
it
would
offer
the
best
hope
and
prospect
to
millions
of
veterans
and
other
american
families
that
the
american
system
can
offer
more
to
them
than
temporary
makeshifts
i
have
said
before
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
can
be
the
best
housed
people
in
the
world
i
repeat
that
assertion
and
i
welcome
the
cooperation
of
the
congress
in
achieving
that
goal
j
social
security
and
health
our
social
security
system
has
just
celebrated
its
tenth
anniversary
during
the
past
decade
this
program
has
supported
the
welfare
and
morale
of
a
large
part
of
our
people
by
removing
some
of
the
hazards
and
hardships
of
the
aged
the
unemployed
and
widows
and
dependent
children
but
looking
back
over
years
experience
and
ahead
to
the
future
we
cannot
fail
to
see
defects
and
serious
inadequacies
in
our
system
as
it
now
exists
benefits
are
in
many
cases
inadequate
a
great
many
persons
are
excluded
from
coverage
and
provision
has
not
been
made
for
social
insurance
to
cover
the
cost
of
medical
care
and
the
earnings
lost
by
the
sick
and
the
disabled
in
the
field
of
oldage
security
there
seems
to
be
no
adequate
reason
for
excluding
such
groups
as
the
selfemployed
agricultural
and
domestic
workers
and
employees
of
nonprofit
organizations
since
many
of
these
groups
earn
wages
too
low
to
permit
significant
savings
for
old
age
they
are
in
special
need
of
the
assured
income
that
can
be
provided
by
oldage
insurance
we
must
take
urgent
measures
for
the
readjustment
period
ahead
the
congress
for
some
time
has
been
considering
legislation
designed
to
supplement
at
federal
expense
during
the
immediate
reconversion
period
compensation
payments
to
the
unemployed
again
i
urge
the
congress
to
enact
legislation
liberalizing
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
extending
the
coverage
providing
for
the
sustained
consumption
by
the
unemployed
persons
and
their
families
is
more
than
a
welfare
policy
it
is
sound
economic
policy
a
sustained
high
level
of
consumer
purchases
is
a
basic
ingredient
of
a
prosperous
economy
during
the
war
nearly
million
men
were
rejected
for
military
service
because
of
physical
or
mental
defects
which
in
many
cases
might
have
been
prevented
or
corrected
this
is
shocking
evidence
that
large
sections
of
the
population
are
at
substandard
levels
of
health
the
need
for
a
program
that
will
give
everyone
opportunity
for
medical
care
is
obvious
nor
can
there
be
any
serious
doubt
of
the
governments
responsibility
for
helping
in
this
human
and
social
problem
the
comprehensive
health
program
which
i
recommended
on
november
will
require
substantial
additions
to
the
social
security
system
and
in
conjunction
with
other
changes
that
need
to
be
made
will
require
further
consideration
of
the
financial
basis
for
social
security
the
system
of
prepaid
medical
care
which
i
have
recommended
is
expected
eventually
to
require
amounts
equivalent
to
percent
of
earnings
up
to
a
year
which
is
about
the
average
of
present
expenditures
by
individuals
for
medical
care
the
pooling
of
medical
costs
under
a
plan
which
permits
each
individual
to
make
a
free
choice
of
doctor
and
hospital
would
assure
that
individuals
receive
adequate
treatment
and
hospitalization
when
they
are
faced
with
emergencies
for
which
they
cannot
budget
individually
in
addition
i
recommended
insurance
benefits
to
replace
part
of
the
earnings
lost
through
temporary
sickness
and
permanent
disability
even
without
these
proposed
major
additions
it
would
now
be
time
to
undertake
a
thorough
reconsideration
of
our
social
security
laws
the
structure
should
be
expanded
and
liberalized
provision
should
be
made
for
extending
coverage
credit
to
veterans
for
the
period
of
their
service
in
the
armed
forces
in
the
financial
provisions
we
must
reconcile
the
actuarial
needs
of
social
security
including
health
insurance
with
the
requirements
of
a
revenue
system
that
is
designed
to
promote
a
high
level
of
consumption
and
full
employment
k
education
although
the
major
responsibility
for
financing
education
rests
with
the
states
some
assistance
has
long
been
given
by
the
federal
government
further
assistance
is
desirable
and
essential
there
are
many
areas
and
some
whole
states
where
good
schools
cannot
be
provided
without
imposing
an
undue
local
tax
burden
on
the
citizens
it
is
essential
to
provide
adequate
elementary
and
secondary
schools
everywhere
and
additional
educational
opportunities
for
large
numbers
of
people
beyond
the
secondary
level
accordingly
i
repeat
the
proposal
of
last
years
budget
message
that
the
federal
government
provide
financial
aid
to
assist
the
states
in
assuring
more
nearly
equal
opportunities
for
a
good
education
the
proposed
federal
grants
for
current
educational
expenditures
should
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
educational
system
where
improvement
is
most
needed
they
should
not
be
used
to
replace
existing
nonfederal
expenditures
or
even
to
restore
merely
the
situation
which
existed
before
the
war
in
the
future
we
expect
incomes
considerably
higher
than
before
the
war
higher
incomes
should
make
it
possible
for
state
and
local
governments
and
for
individuals
to
support
higher
and
more
nearly
adequate
expenditures
for
education
but
inequality
among
the
states
will
still
remain
and
federal
help
will
still
be
needed
as
a
part
of
our
total
public
works
program
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
need
for
providing
adequate
buildings
for
schools
and
other
educational
institutions
in
view
of
current
arrears
in
the
construction
of
educational
facilities
i
believe
that
legislation
to
authorize
grants
for
educational
facilities
to
be
matched
by
similar
expenditures
by
state
and
local
authorities
should
receive
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
the
federal
government
has
not
sought
and
will
not
seek
to
dominate
education
in
the
states
it
should
continue
its
historic
role
of
leadership
and
advice
and
for
the
purpose
of
equalizing
educational
opportunity
it
should
extend
further
financial
support
to
the
cause
of
education
in
areas
where
this
is
desirable
l
federal
government
personnel
the
rapid
reconversion
of
the
federal
government
from
war
to
peace
is
reflected
in
the
demobilization
of
its
civilian
personnel
the
number
of
these
employees
in
continental
united
states
has
been
reduced
by
more
than
from
the
total
of
approximately
employed
in
the
final
months
of
the
war
i
expect
that
by
next
june
we
shall
have
made
a
further
reduction
of
equal
magnitude
and
that
there
will
be
continuing
reductions
during
the
next
fiscal
year
of
the
special
wartime
agencies
now
remaining
only
a
few
are
expected
to
continue
actively
into
the
next
fiscal
year
at
the
same
time
that
we
have
curtailed
the
number
of
employees
we
have
shortened
the
workweek
by
onesixth
or
more
throughout
the
government
and
have
restored
holidays
the
process
of
readjustment
has
been
complicated
and
costs
have
been
increased
by
a
heavy
turnover
in
the
remaining
personnelparticularly
by
the
loss
of
some
of
our
best
administrators
thousands
of
war
veterans
have
been
reinstated
or
newly
employed
in
the
civil
service
many
civilians
have
been
transferred
from
war
agencies
to
their
former
peacetime
agencies
recruitment
standards
which
had
to
be
relaxed
during
the
war
are
now
being
tightened
the
elimination
last
autumn
of
overtime
work
for
nearly
all
federal
employees
meant
a
sharp
cut
in
their
incomes
for
salaried
workers
the
blow
was
softened
but
by
no
means
offset
by
the
increased
rates
of
pay
which
had
become
effective
july
further
adjustments
to
compensate
for
increased
living
costs
are
required
moreover
we
have
long
needed
a
general
upward
revision
of
federal
government
salary
scales
at
all
levels
in
all
brancheslegislative
judicial
and
executive
too
many
in
government
have
had
to
sacrifice
too
much
in
economic
advantage
to
serve
the
nation
adequate
salaries
will
result
in
economies
and
improved
efficiency
in
the
conduct
of
government
businessgains
that
will
far
outweigh
the
immediate
costs
i
hope
the
congress
will
expedite
action
on
salary
legislation
for
all
federal
employees
in
all
branches
of
the
government
the
only
exception
i
would
make
is
in
the
case
of
workers
whose
pay
rates
are
established
by
wage
boards
a
blanket
adjustment
would
destroy
the
system
by
which
their
wages
are

the

boards
should
be
sensitive
now
as
they
were
during
the

to
changes
in
local
prevailing

rates
and
should
make
adjustments
accordingly
i
hope
also
that
the
congress
may
see
fit
to
enact
legislation
for
the
adequate
protection
of
the
health
and
safety
of

for
their

m

of
columbia
the
major
governments
of
the
world
face
few
problems
as
important
and
as
perplexing
as
those
relating
to
dependent
peoples
this
government
is
committed
to
the
democratic
principle
that
it
is
for
the
dependent
peoples
themselves
to
decide
what
their
status
shall
be
to
this
end
i
asked
the
congress
last
october
to
provide
a
means
by
which
the
people
of
puerto
rico
might
choose
their
form
of
government
and
ultimate
status
with
respect
to
the
united
states
i
urge
too
that
the
congress
promptly
accede
to
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
hawaii
that
the
territory
be
admitted
to
statehood
in
our
union
and
that
similar
action
be
taken
with
respect
to
alaska
as
soon
as
it
is
certain
that
this
is
the
desire
of
the
people
of
that
great
territory
the
people
of
the
virgin
islands
should
be
given
an
increasing
measure
of
selfgovernment
we
have
already
determined
that
the
philippine
islands
are
to
be
independent
on
july
the
ravages
of
war
and
enemy
occupation
however
have
placed
a
heavy
responsibility
upon
the
united
states
i
urge
that
the
congress
complete
as
promptly
and
as
generously
as
may
be
possible
legislation
which
will
aid
economic
rehabilitation
for
the
philippines
this
will
be
not
only
a
just
acknowledgment
of
the
loyalty
of
the
people
of
the
philippines
but
it
will
help
to
avoid
the
economic
chaos
which
otherwise
will
be
their
heritage
from
our
common
war
perhaps
no
event
in
the
long
centuries
of
colonialism
gives
more
hope
for
the
pattern
of
the
future
than
the
independence
of
the
philippines
the
district
of
columbia
because
of
its
special
relation
to
the
federal
government
has
been
treated
since
as
a
dependent
area
we
should
move
toward
a
greater
measure
of
local
selfgovernment
consistent
with
the
constitutional
status
of
the
district
we
should
take
adequate
steps
to
assure
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
are
not
denied
their
franchise
merely
because
they
reside
at

iii
the
budget
for
the
federal
program
for
the
fiscal
year
summary
of
the
budget
for
the
first
time
since
the
fiscal
year
the
budget
for
the
next
fiscal
year
will
require
no
increase
in
the
national
debt
expenditures
of
all
kinds
authorized
and
recommended
in
the
next
year
are
estimated
at
just
above
billion
dollars
net
receipts
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
the
estimated
difference
of
billion
dollars
will
be
met
by
a
reduction
in
the
very
substantial
balance
which
will
be
in
the
treasury
during
the
next
fiscal
year
a
large
part
of
the
activities
outside
defense
and
war
liquidation
aftermath
of
war
and
international
finance
classified
as
other
activities
in
a
following
table
is
still
due
to
repercussions
of
the
war
these
other
activities
include
more
than
billion
dollars
for
aids
to
agriculture
and
net
outlays
for
the
commodity
credit
corporationalmost
double
the
expenditures
for
the
same
purposes
in
prewar
years
this
increase
is
due
mainly
to
expenditures
for
purposes
of
price
stabilization
and
price
support
resulting
from
the
war
food
production
program
other
increases
in
this
category
are
due
to
the
fact
that
certain
wartime
agencies
now
in
the
process
of
liquidation
are
included
in
this
group
of
activities
if
all
expenditures
for
those
activities
which
are
directly
or
indirectly
related
to
the
war
are
excluded
the
residual
expenditures
are
below
those
for
corresponding
activities
in
prewar
years
in
making
this
comparison
account
should
be
taken
of
the
fact
that
while
prewar
expenditures
were
affected
by
direct
relief
and
work
relief
for
the
unemployed
the
postwar
budgets
are
affected
by
the
considerable
increase
in
pay
rates
and
other
increases
in
costs
and
prices
to
elaborate
the
budget
as
i
have
remarked
above
reflects
on
both
sides
of
the
ledger
the
governments
program
as
recommended
by
the
executive
it
includes
estimates
not
only
of
expenditures
and
receipts
for
which
legislative
authority
already
exists
but
also
of
expenditures
and
receipts
for
which
authorization
is
recommended
the
budget
total
for
the
next
fiscal
year
the
year
that
ends
on
june
is
estimated
at
just
above
billion
dollarsabout
a
third
of
the
budgets
for
global
war
although
nearly
four
times
the
prewar
budgets
this
estimate
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
a
rapid
liquidation
of
the
war
program
will
be
associated
with
rapid
reconversion
and
expansion
of
peacetime
production
the
total
includes
net
outlays
of
government
corporations
the
estimated
expenditures
in
the
next
and
current
fiscal
year
compare
as
follows
with
those
of
a
year
of
global
war
and
a
prewar
year
total
budget
expenditures
fiscal
year
in
millions
although
allowances
for
occupation
demobilization
and
defense
are
drastically
reduced
in
the
fiscal
year
they
will
still
amount
to
percent
of
the
total
budget
the
socalled
aftermath
of
war
expenditures
account
for
a
further
percent
of
the
total
the
total
of
all
other
programs
which
was
drastically
cut
during
the
war
is
increasing
again
as
liquidation
of
the
war
program
proceeds
and
renewed
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
peacetime
objectives
of
the
government
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
net
receipts
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
this
estimate
assumes
that
all
existing
taxes
will
continue
all
through
the
fiscal
year
included
are
the
extraordinary
receipts
from
the
disposal
of
surplus
property
as
a
result
estimated
expenditures
will
exceed
estimated
receipts
by
billion
dollars
this
amount
can
be
provided
by
a
reduction
in
the
cash
balance
in
the
treasury
thus
after
a
long
period
of
increasing
public
debt
resulting
from
depression
budgets
and
war
budgets
it
is
anticipated
that
no
increase
in
the
federal

will
be

we
were
still
fighting
a
major

and
federal
expenditures
were
running
at
an
annual
rate
of
about
billion

by
june
that
rate
will
be
more
than
cut
in

the

total

current

is
now
estimated
at
billion
dollars
of
which
more
than
twothirds
provides
for

since

are
estimated
at

there
will
be
an

it

that

of
the

are
initial

these

such
as
that

amounts
in

the

exclude
major
elements
of
the

program
since
the
greater
part
of
these

the

as

the

drastic
because

have
absorbed
in
large
measure
the

which

are
beginning
now
for
the
first

in

contributed
to
the

in

the
drastic

has
thrown

it

not
thrown
it
out

our

demonstrates
remarkable
resiliency
although
there
are
many
difficulties
that
must
still
be
overcome
the
rapid
termination
of
war
contracts
prompt
clearance
of
unneeded
governmentowned
equipment
from
private
plants
and
other
reconversion
policies
have
greatly
speeded
up
the

of

although
the
first
great
shock
of
demobilization
and

termination
has
thus
been
met
better
than
many
observers
expected
specific
industries
and
specific

show
much
unevenness
in
the
progress
of

the
quarterly
report
of
the

of

analyzes
the
difficulties
in
recruiting
personnel
and
obtaining
materials
that
hamper
reconversion
in
certain
industries
and
proposes
policies
to
deal
with
these
situations
the
lack
of
adequate
housing
is
one
of
the
main
factors
checking
the

of

into

where
job
opportunities
exist
federal

i
financial
requirements
and

policy
recommendations
for

legislation
should
be
considered
not
only
in
the
light
of
the
financial
requirements
of
the
ensuing
year
but
also
in
the
light
of
future
years
financial
requirements
and
a
full
consideration
of
economic
conditions
expenditures
are
estimated
at
nearly
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
they
can
hardly
be
expected
to
be
reduced
to
less
than
billion
dollars
in
subsequent
years
net
receipts
in
the
fiscal
year
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
included
in
this
estimate
are
billion
dollars
of
receipts
from
disposal
and
rental
of
surplus
property
and
million
dollars
of
receipts
from
renegotiation
of
wartime
contracts
these
sources
of
receipts
will
disappear
in
future
years
tax
collections
for
the
fiscal
year
also
will
not
yet
fully
reflect
the
reduction
in
corporate
tax
liabilities
provided
in
the
revenue
act
of
if
the
extraordinary
receipts
from
the
disposal
of
surplus
property
and
renegotiation
of
contracts
be
disregarded
and
if
the
tax
reductions
adopted
in
the
revenue
act
of
were
fully
effective
present
tax
rates
would
yield
about
billion
dollars
these
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
are
based
on
the
assumption
of
generally
favorable
business
conditions
but
not
on
an
income
reflecting
full
employment
and
the
high
productivity
that
we
hope
to
achieve
in
future
years
the
present
tax
system
in
conjunction
with
a
full
employment
level
of
national
income
could
be
expected
to
yield
more
than
billion
dollars
which
is
substantially
above
the
anticipated
peacetime
level
of
expenditures
in
view
of
the
still
extraordinarily
large
expenditures
in
the
coming
year
and
continuing
inflationary
pressures
i
am
making
no
recommendation
for
tax
reduction
at
this
time
we
have
already
had
a
substantial
reduction
in
taxes
from
wartime
peaks
the
revenue
act
of
was
a
major
taxreduction
measure
it
decreased
the
total
tax
load
by
more
than
onesixth
an
amount
substantially
in
excess
of
the
reductions
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
congressional
tax
committees
in
october
these
proposed
reductions
were
designed
to
encourage
reconversion
and
peacetime
business
expansion
the
possibility
of
further
tax
reductions
must
depend
on
the
budgetary
situation
and
the
economic
situation
the
level
of
anticipated
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
and
the
volume
of
outstanding
public
debt
require
the
maintenance
of
large
revenues
moreover
inflationary
pressures
still
appear
dangerously
powerful
and
illadvised
tax
reduction
would
operate
to
strengthen
them
still
further
my
decision
not
to
recommend
additional
tax
reductions
at
this
time
is
made
in
the
light
of
existing
economic
conditions
and
prospects
borrowing
and
the
public
debt
the
successful
conclusion
of
the
victory
loan
marked
the
end
of
war
borrowing
and
the
beginning
of
the
transition
to
postwar
debt
management
because
of
the
success
of
the
victory
loan
i
am
happy
to
report
that
the
treasury
will
not
need
to
borrow
any
new
money
from
the
public
during
the
remainder
of
the
present
fiscal
year
except
through
regular
sales
of
savings
bonds
and
savings
notes
furthermore
a
part
of
the
large
cash
balance
now
in
the
treasury
will
be
used
for
debt
redemption
so
that
the
public
debt
which
now
amounts
to
about
billion
dollars
will
decrease
by
several
billion
dollars
during
the
next
months
the
present
statutory
debt
limit
of
billion
dollars
will
provide
an
ample
margin
for
all
of
the
publicdebt
transactions
through
the
fiscal
year
the
net
effect
of
the
excess
of
expenditures
and
debt
redemption
on
the
treasury
cash
balance
as
compared
with
selected
previous

these

represent
a
convenient

also
an

government

to

of

during

more
during

through
these
and
other

operations
the
distribution
of
the

among
the
various
types

and
private
owners
will
change
even
though
the
total
is

the

policies
followed
in

operations
will
have
a
major
impact
not

on
the
provision
for
interest
payments
in
future
budgets
but
also
on
the
level
of
interest
rates
prevailing
in
private
financing
the
average
rate
of
interest
on
the
debt
is
now
a
little
under
percent
low
interest
rates
will
be
an
important
force
in
promoting
the
full
production
and
full
employment
in
the
postwar
period
for
which
we
are
all
striving
close
wartime
cooperation
between
the
treasury
department
and
the
federal
reserve
system
has
made
it
possible
to
finance
the
most
expensive
war
in
history
at
low
and
stable
rates
of
interest
this
cooperation
will
continue
no
less
important
than
the
level
of
interest
rates
paid
on
the
debt
is
the
distribution
of
its
ownership
of
the
total

more
than
half
represents
direct

banks
heavy

by
the

were
necessary
to
provide
adequate

to
finance
war
expenditures
a
considerable
portion
of
these
obligations
are
shortterm
in
character
and
hence
will
require
refinancing
in
the
coming
months
and
years
since
they
have
been
purchased
out
of
newly
created
bank
funds
continuance
of
the
present
low
rates
of

is
entirely
appropriate
to
do
otherwise
would
merely
increase
bank
profits
at
the
expense
of
the
taxpayer
the
billion
dollar
debt
poses
a
problem
that
requires
careful
consideration
in
the
determination
of
financial
and
economic
policies
we
have
learned
that
the
problem
serious
as
it
is
can
be
managed
its
management
will
require
determined
action
to
keep
our
federal
budget
in
order
and
to
relate
our
fiscal
policies
to
the
requirements
of
an
expanding
economy
the
more
successful
we
are
in
achieving
full
production
and
full
employment
the
easier
it
will
be
to
manage
the
debt
and
pay
for
the
debt
service
large
though
the
debt
is
it
is
within
our
economic
capacity
the
interest
charges
on
it
amount
to
but
a
small
proportion
of
our
national
income
the
government
is
determined
by
a
resolute
policy
of
economic
stabilization
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
millions
of
american
citizens
who
have
invested
in
its
securities
during
the
past
months
the
net
revenue
receipts
of
the
federal
government
have
been
about
billion
dollars
almost
as
much
as
during
the
closing
months
of
when
the
country
was
still
engaged
in
allout
warfare
the
high
level
of
these
receipts
reflects
the
smoothness
of
the
reconversion
and
particularly
the
strength
of
consumer
demand
but
the
receipts
so
far
collected
it
must
be
remembered
do
not
reflect
any
of
the
tax
reductions
made
by
the
revenue
act
of
these
reductions
will
not
have
their
full
effect
on
the
revenue
collected
until
the
fiscal
year
it
is
good
to
move
toward
a
balanced
budget
and
a
start
on
the
retirement
of
the
debt
at
a
time
when
demand
for
goods
is
strong
and
the
business
outlook
is
good
these
conditions
prevail
today
business
is
good
and
there
are
still
powerful
forces
working
in
the
direction
of

we
shall
also
lay
the

for
our

system
of

in
the

that
ended
on

almost
wholly
a
period
of
global

war
expenditures
amounted
to
billion
dollars
for
the

war
expenditures
were
originally
estimated
at
billion
dollars
that
estimate
was
made
a
year
ago
while
we
were
still
engaged
in
global
warfare
after
victory
over
japan
this
estimate
was
revised
to
billion
dollars
further
cutbacks
and
accelerated
demobilization
have
made
possible
an
additional
reduction
in
the
rate
of
war
spending
during
the
first
months
billion
dollars
were
spent
it
is
now
estimated
that
billion
dollars
will
be
spent
during
the
second
months
or
a
total
of
billion
dollars
during
the
whole
fiscal
year
for
the
fiscal
year
it
is
estimated
tentatively
that
expenditures
for
war
liquidation
for
occupation
and
for
national
defense
will
be
reduced
to
billion
dollars
the
war
and
navy
departments
are
expected
to
spend
billion
dollars
expenditures
of
other
agencies
such
as
the
united

maritime
commission
the
war
shipping
administration
and
the
office
of

administration
and

to
the

are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
allowing
for
estimated
net
receipts
of
billion
dollars
arising
from
war
activities
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
the
estimated
total
of
war
expenditures
is
billion
dollars
at
this
time
only
a
tentative
breakdown
of
the
total
estimate
for
war
and
defense
activities
can
be
indicated
an
expenditure
of
billion
dollars
for
war
liquidation
occupation
and
national
defense
is
a
large
sum
for
a
year
which
begins
months
after
fighting
has
ended
it
is
times
our
expenditures
for
defense
before
the
war
it
amounts
to
about
percent
of
our
expected
national
income
this
estimate
reflects
the
immense
job
that
is
involved
in
winding
up
a
global
war
effort
and
stresses
the
great
responsibility
that
victory
has
placed
upon
this
country
the
large
expenditures
needed
for
our
national
defense
emphasize
the
great
scope
for
effective
organization
in
furthering
economy
and
efficiency
to
this
end
i
have
recently
recommended
to
the
congress
adoption
of
legislation
combining
the
war
and
navy
departments
into
a
single
department
of
national
defense
a
large
part
of
these
expenditures
is
still
to
be
attributed
to
the
costs
of
the
war
assuming
somewhat
arbitrarily
that
about
onehalf
of
the
billiondollar
outlay
for
the
fiscal
year
is
for
war
liquidation
aggregate
expenditures
by
this
government
for
the
second
world
war
are
now
estimated
at
billion
dollars
through
june
of
this
about
billion
dollars
will
have
been
recovered
through
renegotiation
and
sale
of
surplus
property
by
june
this
has
been
reflected
in
the
estimates
of

demobilization
and
strength
of

forcesdemobilization
of
our
armed
forces
is
proceeding
rapidly
at
the
time
of

in

about
million
men
and
women
were
in
the
armed
forces
million
were
overseas
by
the
end
of
december
our
armed
forces
had
been
reduced
to
below

by
june
they
will
number
about
million
of

million
will
be
individuals
enlisted
and
inducted
after
veday
musteringout
pay
is
a
large
item
of
our
war
liquidation
expense
it
will
total
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
and
about
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
in
the
fiscal
year
the
strength
of
our
armed
forces
will
still
be
above
the
ultimate
peacetime
level
as
i
have
said
war
and
navy
department
requirements
indicate
a
strength
of
about
million
in
the
armed
forces
a
year
from
now
this
is
necessary
to
enable
us
to
do
our
share
in
the
occupation
of
enemy
territories
and
in
the
preservation
of
peace
in
a
troubled
world
expenditures
for

are

disposalthe
winding
up
of
war
procurement
is
the
second
most
important
liquidation
job
by
the
end
of
november
a
total
of
prime
contracts
involving
commitments
of
billion
dollars
had
been
terminated
of
this
total
contracts
with
commitments
of
billion
dollars
remained
to
be
settled
termination
payments
on
these
contracts
are
estimated
at
about
billion
dollars
it
is
expected
that
more
than
half
of
these
terminated
contracts
will
be
settled
during
the
current
fiscal
year
leaving
payments
of
about
billion
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
another
important
aspect
of
war
supply
liquidation
is
the
disposal
of
surplus
property
munitions
ships
plants
installations
and
supplies
originally
costing
billion
dollars
or
more
will
ultimately
be
declared
surplus
the
sale
value
of
this
property
will
be
far
less
than
original
cost
and
disposal
expenses
are
estimated
at
to
cents
on
each
dollar
realized
disposal
units
within
existing
agencies
have
been
organized
to
liquidate
surplus
property
under
the
direction
of
the
surplus
property
administration
overseas
disposal
activities
have
been
centralized
in
the
state
department
to
permit
this
program
to
be
carried
on
in
line
with
overall
foreign
policy
thus
far
only
about
billion
dollars
of
the
ultimate
surplus
including
billion
dollars
of
unsalable
aircraft
has
been
declared
of
this
amount
billion
dollars
have
been
disposed
of
in
sales
yielding
million
dollars
the
tremendous
job
of
handling
surplus
stocks
will
continue
to
affect
federal
expenditures
and
receipts
for
several
years
the
speed
and
effectiveness
of
surplus
disposal
operations
will
be
of
great
importance
for
the
domestic
economy
as
well
as
for
foreign
economic
policies
war
supplies
maintenance
and
reliefadequate
provision
for
the
national
defense
requires
that
we
keep
abreast
of
scientific
and
technical
advances
the
tentative
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
make
allowance
for
military
research
limited
procurement
of
weapons
in
the
developmental
state
and
some
regular
procurement
of
munitions
which
were
developed
but
not
massproduced
when
the
war
ended
expenditures
for
procurement
and
construction
will
constitute
onethird
or
less
of
total
defense
outlays
compared
to
a
ratio
of
twothirds
during
the
war
years
the
estimates
also
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
our
warexpanded
naval
and
merchant
fleets
military
installations
and
stocks
of
military
equipment
and
supplies
our
naval
combatant
fleet
is
three
times
its
prepearl
harbor
tonnage
our
merchant
marine
is
five
times
its
prewar
size
the
war
department
has
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
equipment
and
supplies
considerable
maintenance
and
repair
expense
is
necessary
for
the
equipment
which
we
desire
to
retain
in
active
status
or
in
war
reserve
expenses
will
be
incurred
for
winnowing
the
stocks
of
surpluses
for
preparing
layup
facilities
for
the
reserve
fleets
and
for
storage
of
reserve
equipment
and

military
expenditures
in
the
current
fiscal
year
include
million
dollars
for
civilian
supplies
for
the
prevention
of
starvation
and
disease
in
occupied
areas
expenditures
on
this
account
will
continue
in
the
fiscal
year
the
war
expenditures
also
cover
the
expenses
of
civilian
administration
in
occupied
areas
during
the
war
cents
of
each
dollar
of
our
war
expenditures
was
for
lendlease
aid
with
lendlease
terminated
i
expect
the
direct
operations
under
this
program
to
be
substantially
completed
in
the
current
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
estimated
for
the
fiscal
year
under
this
program
are
mainly
interagency
reimbursements
for
past
transactions
relief
and
rehabilitation
expenditures
are
increasing
it
is
imperative
that
we
give
all
necessary
aid
within
our
means
to
the
people
who
have
borne
the
ravages
of
war
i
estimate
that
in
the
fiscal
year
expenditures
for
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
will
total
billion
dollars
and
in
the
following
year
billion
dollars
insofar
as
possible
procurement
for
this
purpose
will
be
from
war
surpluses
b
authorizations
for
war
and
national
defense
during
the
war
authorizations
and
appropriations
had
to
be
enacted
well
in
advance
of
obligation
and
spending
to
afford
ample
time
for
planning
of
production
by
the
procurement
services
and
by
industry
thus
our
cumulative
war
program
authorized
in
the
period
between
july
and
july
was
billion
dollars
including
net
war
commitments
of
government
corporations
expenditures
against
those
authorizations
totaled
billion
dollars
this
left
billion
dollars
in
unobligated
authorizations
and
unliquidated
obligations
with
the
end
of
fighting
it
became
necessary
to
adjust
war
authorizations
to
the
requirements
of
war
liquidation
and
continuing
national
defense
intensive
review
of
the
war
authorizations
by
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
has
been
continued
since
vjday
as
a
result
the
authorized
war
program
is
being
brought
more
nearly
into
line
with
expenditures
recisions
and
authorizations
through
the
fiscal
year
readjusting
the
war
program
as
the
congress
well
knows
is
not
an
easy
task
authorizations
must
not
be
too
tight
lest
we
hamper
necessary
operations
they
must
not
be
too
ample
lest
we
lose
control
of
spending
last
september
i
transmitted
to
the
congress
recommendations
on
the
basis
of
which
the
congress
voted
hr
to
repeal
billion
dollars
of
appropriations
and
authorizations
i
found
it
necessary
to
veto
this
bill
because
it
was
used
as
a
vehicle
for
legislation
that
would
impair
the
reemployment
program
however
in
order
to
preserve
the
fine
work
of
the
congress
on
the
recisions
i
asked
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget
to
place
the
exact
amounts
indicated
for
repeal
in
a
nonexpendable
reserve
and
to
advise
the
departments
and
agencies
accordingly
this
has
been
done
in
accord
with
public
law
of
the
seventyninth
congress
i
have
transmitted
recommendations
for
additional
rescissions
for
the
current
fiscal
year
of
appropriations
amounting
to
billion
dollars
and
of
contract
authorizations
totaling
million
dollars
the
net
reduction
in
authority
to
obligate
will
be
billion
dollars
because
of
the
appropriations
billion
dollars
will
have
to
be
restored
in
subsequent
years
to
liquidate
contract
authorizations
still
on
the
books
the
appropriations
recommended
for
repeal
include
million
dollars
for
the
navy
department
million
dollars
for
the
war
department
million
dollars
for
lendlease
million
dollars
for
the
war
shipping
administration
and
million
dollars
for
the
united
states
maritime
commission
the
contract
authorizations
proposed
for
repeal
are
for
the
maritime
commission
in
addition
there
are
unused
tonnage
authorizations
for
construction
of
naval
vessels
now
valued
at
billion
dollars
in
september
i
suggested
that
this
authority
be
reviewed
by
the
appropriate
committees
of
the
congress
and
the
congress
has
moved
to
bar
construction
under
these
authorizations
during
the
remainder
of
the
fiscal
year
i
propose
to
continue
this
prohibition
in
the
navy
budget
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
and
now
renew
my
recommendation
that
legislation
be
enacted
at
the
earliest
time
to
dear
the
statute
books
of
these
authorizations
the
amounts
indicated
for
repeal
in
hr
and
the
further
rescissions
which
i
have
recommended
excluding
duplications
and
deferred
cash
payments
on
existing
authorizations
represent
a
cut
in
the
authorized
war
program
of
billion
dollars
the
war
authorizations
will
also
be
reduced
billion
dollars
by
carrying
receipts
of
revolving
accounts
to
surplus
by
lapses
and
by
cancellation
and
repayment
of
commitments
of
the
government
war
corporations
on
the
other
hand
supplemental
appropriations
of
million
dollars
will
be
required
for
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
in
the
net
it
is
estimated
that
the
cumulative
authorized
war
and
national
defense
program
will
amount
to
billion
dollars
on
june
expenditures
of
billion
dollars
during
the
fiscal
year
will
have
pushed
cumulative
expenditures
to
billion
dollars
the
unexpended
balances
will
be
down
to
billion
dollars
on
june
new
authorizations
for
national
defense
and
war
liquidation
in
the
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
of
billion
dollars
for
national
defense
and
war
liquidation
in
the
fiscal
year
will
be
partly
for
payment
of
contractual
obligations
incurred
in
the
past
and
partly
for
the
payment
of
new
obligations
the
unexpended
balances
on
june
will
be
scattered
among
hundreds
of
separate
appropriations
thus
while
some
appropriation
accounts
will
have
unused
balances
others
will
require
additional
appropriations
it
is
estimated
that
authorizations
to
incur
new
obligations
of
million
dollars
will
be
needed
during
the
fiscal
year
mainly
for
the
war
and
navy
departments
of
the
required
authorizations
million
dollars
will
be
in
new
appropriations
million
dollars
in
new
contract
authority
and
million
dollars
in
reappropriations
of
unobligated
balances
in
addition
appropriations
of
million
dollars
will
be
needed
to
liquidate
obligations
under
existing
contract
authorizations
taking
into
account
the
tentative
authorizations
and
expenditures
estimated
for
the
fiscal
year
and
offsets
of
billion
dollars
in
war
commitments
of
government
corporations
the
cumulative
authorized
war
and
national
defense
program
on
june
will
be
billion
dollars
total
expenditures
billion
dollars
and
unexpended
balances
billion
dollars
the
billion
dollars
of
unexpended
balances
tentatively
indicated
as
of
june
comprise
both
unobligated
authorizations
and
unliquidated
obligations
most
of
the
unliquidated
obligations
result
from
transactions
booked
during
the
war
years
a
large
part
of
the
billion
dollars
would
never
be
spent
even
if
not
repealed
for
the
appropriations
will
lapse
in
due
course
for
example
several
billion
dollars
of
these
unliquidated
obligations
represent
unsettled
inter
and
intradepartmental
agency
accounts
for
war
procurement
legislation
is
being
requested
to
facilitate
the
adjustment
of
some
of
these
interagency
accounts
another
billion
dollars
is
set
aside
for
contract
termination
payments
if
contract
settlement
costs
continue
in
line
with
recent
experience
it
is
likely
that
part
of
the
billion
dollars
will
remain
unspent
on
the
other
hand
some
of
the
billion
dollars
would
be
available
for
obligation
and
expenditure
unless
impounded
in
certain
appropriations
such
as
those
for
longcycle
procurement
considerable
carryover
of
unliquidated
obligations
into
future
years
is
to
be
expected
and
is
necessary
however
substantial
further
rescissions
can
and
should
be
made
when
the
war
liquidation
program
tapers
off
and
budgetary
requirements
for
national
defense
are
clarified
as
i
have
said
i
shall
continue
to
review
the
war
authorizations
and
from
time
to
time
recommend
excess
balances
for
repeal
as
in
recent
years
detailed
recommendations
concerning
most
appropriations
for
the
national
defense
program
are
postponed
until
the
spring
in
connection
with
the
war
activities
of
the
united
states
maritime
commission
and
certain
other
agencies
however
i
now
make
specific
recommendations
for
the
fiscal
year
no
additional
authorizations
or
appropriations
will
be
necessary
for
the
maritime
commission
since
sufficient
balances
will
be
left
after
the
abovementioned
rescissions
to
carry
out
the
program
now
contemplated
for
the
fiscal
year
aftermath
of
war
nearly
onethird
billion
dollarsof
estimated
federal
expenditures
in
the
fiscal
year
will
be
for
purposes
that
are
largely
inherited
from
the
warpayments
to
veterans
interest
on
the
federal
debt
and
refunds
of
taxes
a
for
veterans
veterans
pensions
and
benefits
has
become
one
of
the
largest
single
categories
in
the
federal
budget
i
am
recommending
for
this
purpose
total
appropriations
of
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
expenditures
in
the
fiscal
year
are
estimated
under
present
legislation
at
million
dollars
these
expenditures
will
help
our
veterans
through
their
readjustment
period
and
provide
lasting
care
for
those
who
were
disabled
the
congress
has
provided
unemployment
allowances
for
veterans
during
their
readjustment
period
expenditure
of
million
dollars
for
this
purpose
is
anticipated
for
the
fiscal
year
in
addition
readjustment
allowances
for
selfemployed
veterans
are
expected
to
cost
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
on
may
in
asking
the
congress
to
raise
the
ceiling
on
benefits
for
civilian
unemployed
to
not
less
than
dollars
a
week
during
the
immediate
reconversion
period
i
suggested
that
the
congress
also
consider
liberalizing
veterans
allowances
elsewhere
in
this
message
i
reiterate
my
recommendation
with
respect
to
emergency
unemployment
compensation
i
also
recommend
increasing
veterans
unemployment
allowances
from
dollars
to
dollars
a
week
this
would
involve
additional
expenditures
estimated
at
approximately
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
included
in
the
budget
is
an
expenditure
of
million
dollars
for
veterans
education
under
provisions
of
the
servicemens
readjustment
act
this
amount
includes
both
tuition
expenses
and
maintenance
allowances
it
is
expected
that
half
a
million
veterans
will
be
enrolled
in
our
schools
and
colleges
during
the
year
the
ultimate
benefit
which
veterans
receive
from
the
loan
guarantee
provisions
of
the
servicemens
readjustment
act
depends
largely
on
the
success
of
our
stabilization
program
in
restraining
building
costs
and
real
estate
values
under
the
revised
procedure
contained
in
recent
amendments
the
administrative
workload
will
be
minimized
by
the
almost
complete
transfer
of
authority
for
approving
the
guarantees
to
private
lending
agencies
and
private
appraisers
designated
by
the
veterans
administration
this
authority
carries
with
it
the
responsibility
for
restricting
the
guarantees
to
loans
on
reasonably
valued
properties
costs
of
the
program
other
than
for
administration
are
estimated
at
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
pensions
for
veterans
will
require
expenditures
estimated
at
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
twothirds
of
this
amount
will
be
received
by
veterans
of
the
war
which
we
have
just
won
this
figure
includes
million
dollars
of
increased
pensions
for
studentveterans
in
our
vocational
rehabilitation
program
in
addition
million
dollars
will
be
expended
in
transfers

from
general
and

accounts
expenditures
under
the
appropriation
for
salaries
and
expenses
of
the
veterans
administration
are
estimated
at
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
this
includes
million
dollars
for
medical
care
and
the
operation
of
some
hospital
and
domiciliary
beds
a
separate
appropriation
for
hospital
and
domiciliary
facilities
additional
to
the
total
for
veterans
pensions
and
benefits
covers
construction
that
will
provide
some
hospital
beds
as
part
of
the
million
dollar
hospital
construction
program
already
authorized
by
the
congress
the
estimated
expenditures
of
million
dollars
for
this
purpose
are
classified
in
the
budget
as
part
of
the
general
public
works
program
for
the
next
fiscal
year
b
for
interest
interest
payments
on
the
public
debt
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
an
increase
of
million
dollars
from
the
revised
estimate
for
the
current
fiscal
year
this
increase
reflects
chiefly
payment
of
interest
on
additions
to
the
debt
this
year
assuming
continuance
of
present
interest
rates
the
governments
interest
bill
is
now
reaching
the
probable
postwar
level
c
for
refunds
an
estimated
total
of
million
dollars
of
refunds
will
be
paid
to
individuals
and
corporations
during
the
fiscal
year
slightly
over
half
of
this
amount
or
million
dollars
will
be
accessory
to
the
simplified
payasyougo
method
of
tax
collection
and
will
be
the
result
of
overwithholding
and
over
declaration
of
expected
income
most
of
the
remainder
will
arise
from
loss
and
excessprofits

this
category
of

by
the
succeeding

will
reflect
almost
entirely
the
normal
operation
of

and
current
tax
collection
agricultural
programs
the
agricultural
programs
contemplated
for
the
fiscal

are
those
which
are
essential
for
the
provision
of
an
adequate
supply
of

other
agricultural
commodities
with
a
fair

recommend

including
the
existing

equal
to
percent
of

a
reappropriation
of

for

from

corporation
for
the

programs
of

it
is
expected
that

some
detailed

the
socalled
aaa
programfor
the
fiscal
year
compared
with
million
dollars
in
the
current
year
this
reduction
of
million
dollars
is
in
large
part
accounted
for
by
elimination
of
the
wartime
flax
production
incentive
project
and
other
nonrecurring
items
the
proposed
reduction
in
normal
activities
is
less
than
million
dollars
for
the
past
several
years
this
program
has
consisted
largely
of
payments
to
farmers
for
application
of
fertilizer
and
other
approved
soil
management
practices
i
am
convinced
that
farmers
generally
are
now
fully
alert
to
the
benefits
both
immediate
and
longterm
which
they
derive
from
the
practices
encouraged
by
this
program
i
believe
therefore
that
this
subsidization
should
continue
to
be
reduced
rural

is
proposed
that
the
loan
authorization
for
the
rural
electrification
administration
for
the
fiscal
year
be
increased
from
million
dollars
to
million
dollars
during
the
war
period
rea
was
limited
by
the
scarcity
of
materials
and
manpower
but
that
situation
is
rapidly
changing
and
the
rea
program
which
was
materially
stepped
up
for
the
fiscal
year
can
be
increased
still
more
it
is
my
belief
that
a
feasible
and
practical
rural
electrification
program
should
be
carried
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
this
will
involve
total
loans
of
approximately
million
dollars
over
the
next
years
much
of
which
will
be
repaid
during
that
period
other
programsit
is
recommended
that
the
continuing
forest
landacquisition
program
be
resumed
at
the
rate
of
million
dollars
annually
which
is
about
the
minimum
rate
at
which
this
program
can
be
economically
carried
on
the
lands
involved
in
this
program
can
contribute
fully
to
the
national
welfare
only
when
brought
into

forest
system
for
protection

such
programs
as
those
of
the

administration
and
the

are
estimated
to
be
continued
during
the
fiscal

at
about
the
same
level
as
in

part
of
this
will
be

the
remainder
through
other

about
million

is
recommended
for
maternity

for

under

mainly
under
the
emergency

of

health

which
will
be
provided
through
the
proposed
general
system
of

medical

legislation
is
needed
to
supplement
such

for

education
i
have
recommended
legislation
authorizing
grantsinaid
to
public
and
nonprofit
institutions
the
existing
sources
of
support
for
medical
schools
require
supplementation
to
sustain
the
expansion
that
is
needed
hospitals
sanitation
works
and
additional
facilities
at
medical

will
be
required
for
an
adequate
national
health
program
legislation
is
now
pending
in
the
congress
to
authorize
grants
for
the
construction
of
hospitals
and
health
centers
and
grants
and
loans
for
waterpollution
control
i
hope
the
congress
will
act
favorably
on
generous
authorizing
legislation
research
and
education
the
budget
provides
for
continuation
and
desirable
expansion
of
the
research
activities
that
are
carried
on
throughout
the
federal
establishment
and
through
previously
authorized
grants
to
the
states
additional
appropriations
will
be
required
for
the
proposed
central
federal
research
agency
which
i
recommended
last
september
that
agency
will
coordinate
existing
research
activities
and
administer
funds
for
new
research
activities
wherever
they
are
needed
it
will
not
itself
conduct
research
the
plan
contemplates
expenditures
through
the
new
research
agency
of
approximately
million
dollars
for
the
first
year
these
amounts
are
small
in
relation
to
the
important
contribution
they
can
make
to
the
national
income
the
welfare
of
our
people
and
the
common
defense
expenditures
must
be
limited
for
the
time
being
by
the
capacity
of
research
agencies
to
make
wise
use
of
funds
the
maintenance
of
our
position
as
a
nation
however
will
require
more
emphasis
on
research
expenditures
in
the
future
than
in
the
past
educational
expenditures
will
require
a
significant
share
of
the
national
income
in
the
fiscal
year
state
local
and
private
expenditures
for
the
current
support
of
elementary
secondary
and
higher
education
are
expected
to
be
substantially
above
billion
dollars
in
that
year
these
nonfederal
expenditures
will
be
supplemented
by
federal
expenditures
estimated
at
million
dollars
in
the
present
budget
of
this
amount
the
estimate
for
veterans
education
as
previously
mentioned
is
million
dollars
other
amounts
include
million
dollars
for
the
support
of
vocational
education
in
public
schools
million
dollars
for
the
landgrant
colleges
million
dollars
for
the
present
schoollunch
and
milk
program
million
dollars
for
the
office
of
education
and
approximately
million
dollars
for
various
other
items
in
view
of
the
major
policy
issues
which
are
still
under
study
by
the
congress
and
the
administration
no
specific
amount
has
been
determined
for
the
federal
grants
previously
recommended
in
this
message
which
would
assist
the
states
generally
in
assuring
more
nearly
equal
opportunities
for
a
good
education
notwithstanding
the
urgent
need
for
additional
school
and
college
buildings
careful
planning
will
be
required
for
the
expenditures
to
be
made
under
the
proposed
legislation
to
aid
the
states
in
providing
educational
facilities
a
major
share
of
the
grants
for
the
first
year
would
be
for
surveys
and
plans
i
have
already
outlined
the
broad
objectives
of
our
foreign
economic
policy
in
the
present
section
i
shall
indicate
the
federal
outlays
which
the
execution
of
these
programs
may
require
in
the
fiscal
years
and
a
on
the
termination
of
lendlease
the
lendlease
countries
were
required
to
pay
for
goods
in
the
lendlease
pipe
line
either
in
cash
or
by
borrowing
from
the
united
states
or
by
supplying
goods
and
services
to
the
united
states
credits
for
this
purpose
have
already
been
extended
to
soviet
union
france
the
netherlands
and
belgium
amounting
to
million
dollars
the
settlement
credit
of
million
dollars
to
the
united
kingdom
includes
an
amount
preliminarily
fixed
at
million
dollars
which
represents
the
excess
of
purchases
by
the
united
kingdom
from
the
pipe
line
over
goods
and
services
supplied
by
the
united
kingdom
to
the
united
states
since
vjday
and
the
balance
of
various
claims
by
one
government
against
the
other
credits
are
also
being
negotiated
with
lendlease
countries
to
finance
the
disposition
of
lendlease
inventories
and
installations
and
property
declared
to
be
surplus
for
instance
million
dollars
of
the
settlement
credit
to
the
united
kingdom
is
for
this
purpose
these
credits
will
involve
no
new
expenditures
by
this
government
since
they
merely
provide
for
deferred
repayment
by
other
governments
for
good
services
which
have
been
financed
from
war
appropriations
b
expenditures
from
the
appropriations
to
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
which
were
discarded
under
war
expenditures
above
are
estimated
to
be
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
and
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
c
to
assist
other
countries
in
the
restoration
of
their
economies
the
exportimport
bank
has
already
negotiated
loans
in
the
fiscal
year
amounting
in
total
to
about
million
dollars
and
an
additional
million
dollars
will
probably
be
committed
shortly
the
bank
is
also
granting
loans
to
carry
out
its
original
purpose
of
directly
expanding
the
foreign
trade
of
the
united
states
in
this
connection
the
bank
has
established
a
fund
of
million
dollars
to
finance
the
export
of
cotton
from
the
united
states
the
exportimport
bank
has
thus
loaned
or
committed
approximately
million
dollars
during
the
current
fiscal
year
and
it
is
expected
that
demands
on
its
resources
will
increase
in
the
last
months
of
the
fiscal
year
requests
for
loans
are
constantly
being
received
by
the
bank
from
countries
desiring
to
secure
goods
and
services
in
this
country
for
the
reconstruction
or
development
of
their
economies
on
july
the
lending
authority
of
the
expertimport
bank
was
increased
to
a
total
of
million
dollars
i
anticipate
that
during
the
period
covered
by
this
budget
the
bank
will
reach
this
limit
the
bulk
of
the
expenditures
from
the
loans
already
granted
will
fall
in
the
fiscal
year
while
the
bulk
of
the
expenditures
from
loans
yet
to
be
negotiated
will
fall
in
the
fiscal
year
in
view
of
the
urgent
need
for
the
banks
credit
i
may
find
it
necessary
to
request
a
further
increase
in
its
lending
authority
at
a
later
date
d
the
proposed
line
of
credit
of
million
dollars
to
the
united
kingdom
will
be
available
up
to
the
end
of
and
will
be
used
to
assist
the
united
kingdom
in
financing
the
deficit
in
its
balance
of
payments
during
the
transition
period
the
rate
at
which
the
united
kingdom
will
draw
on
the
credit
will
depend
on
the
rapidity
with
which
it
can
reconvert
its
economy
and
adapt
its
trade
to
the
postwar
world
the
anticipated
rate
of
expenditure
is
likely
to
be
heaviest
during
the
next
years
e
since
the
bretton
woods
agreements
have
now
been
approved
by
the
required
number
of
countries
both
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
international
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
will
commence
operations
during
the
organization
of
these
institutions
will
undoubtedly
take
some
time
and
it
is
unlikely
that
their
operations
will
reach
any
appreciable
scale
before
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
of
the
million
dollars
required
for
the
fund
million
dollars
will
be
provided
in
cash
or
notes
from
the
exchange
stabilization
fund
established
under
the
gold
reserve
act
of
the
remaining
million
dollars
will
be
paid
initially
in
the
form
of
noninterestbearing
notes
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
is
not
anticipated
that
the
fund
will
require
in
cash
any
of
the
million
dollars
during
the
fiscal
years
and
consequently
no
cash
withdrawals
from
the
treasury
will
be
required
in
connection
with
the
fund
in
these
years
the
subscription
to
the
bank
amounts
to
million
dollars
of
this
total
percent
must
be
paid
immediately
and
the
bank
is
required
to
call
a
further
percent
of
the
subscription
during
its
first
year
of
operations
the
balance
of
the
subscription
is
payable
when
required
by
the
bank
either
for
direct
lending
or
to
make
good
its
guarantees
it
is
likely
that
the
united
states
will
be
required
to
pay
little
if
any
more
than
the
initial
percent
before
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
i
anticipate
that
net
expenditures
of
the
exportimport
bank
and
expenditures
arising
from
the
british
credit
and
the
bretton
woods
agreements
will
amount
to
million
dollars
including
the
noncash
item
of
million
dollars
for
the
fund
in
the
fiscal
year
and
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
general
government
the
responsibilities
of
the
government
in
both
domestic
and
international
affairs
have
increased
greatly
in
the
past
decade
consequently
the
government
is
larger
than
it
was
before
the
war
and
its
general
operating
costs
are
higher
we
cannot
shrink
the
government
to
prewar
dimensions
unless
we
slough
off
these
new
responsibilitiesand
we
cannot
do
that
without
paying
an
excessive
price
in
terms
of
our
national
welfare
we
can
however
enhance
its
operating
efficiency
through
improved
organization
i
expect
to
make
such
improvements
under
the
authority
of
the
reorganization
act
of
the
appropriations
which
i
am
recommending
for
general
government
for
the
fiscal
year
are
million
dollars
under
existing
legislation
this
is
an
increase
of
million
dollars
over
the
total
of
enacted
appropriations
for
the
current
fiscal
year
but
a
substantial
part
of
this
increase
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
were
made
prior
to
the
general
increase
of
employees
salaries
last
july
for
which
allowance
is
made
in
the
anticipated
supplemental
appropriations
for
the
recommended
total
for
for
general
government
like
the
estimates
for
national
defense
and
other
specific
programs
does
not
allow
for
the
further
salary
increases
for
government
employees
which
i
hope
will
be
authorized
by
pending
legislation
butthe
tentative
lumpsum
estimates
under
proposed
legislation
contemplate
that
such
salary
increases
will
be
effective
almost
at
once
expenditures
for
general
government
in
the
fiscal
year
are
expected
to
continue
the
slowly
rising
trend
which
began
in
this
category
includes
a
great
variety
of
itemsnot
merely
the
overhead
costs
of
the
government
it
includes
all
the
expenditures
of
the
cabinet
departments
other
than
for
national
defense
aids
to
agriculture
general
public
works
and
the
social
security
program
it
includes
also
expenditures
of
the
legislative
branch
the
judiciary
and
many
of
the
independent
agencies
of
the
executive
branch
consequently
the
estimated
increase
in
in
the
total
of
general
government
expenditures
reflects
a
variety
of
influences
now
included
in
general
government
are
certain
activities
formerly
classified
under
national
defense
some
of
these
such
as
certain
functions
of
the
former
foreign
economic
administration
and
the
war
manpower
commission
are
still
needed
during
the
period
of
reconversion
others
are
in
the
process
of
liquidation
a
few
wartime
activities
for
example
the
international
information
and
foreign
intelligence
services
and
some
of
the
wartime
programs
for
controlling
disease
and
crime
have
become
part
of
our
regular
government
establishment
expenditures
for
these
former
wartime
functions
explain
about
percent
of
the
increase
in
expenditures
for
general
government
other
increases
are
for
civil
aeronautics
promotion
the
business
and
manufacturing
censuses
and
other
expanded
business
services
of
the
department
of
commerce
which
have
been
referred
to
above
the
forest
and
soil
conservation
services
and
other
committees
of
the
department
of
certain
conservation
activities
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
collection
of
internal
revenue
in
the
treasury
department
the
necessity
for
reestablishing
postal
services
curtailed
during
the
war
and
advances
in
the
rates
of
pay
for
postal
employees
have
increased
substantially
the
estimated
expenditures
for
postal
service
for
both
the
current
and
the
next
fiscal
year
it
is
not
expected
that
this
increase
will
cause
expenditures
to
exceed
postal
revenues
in
either
year
although
an
excess
of
expenditures
may
occur
in
the
fiscal
year
if
salaries
are
increased
further
expenditures
for
our
share
of
the
administrative
budgets
of
the
united
nations
and
other
permanent
international
bodies
will
increase
sharply
in
the
fiscal
year
yet
will
remain
a
small
part
of
our
total
budget
the
budget
for
the
united
nations
has
not
yet
been
determined
an
estimate
for
our
contribution
will
be
submitted
later
our
contributions
to
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
the
international
labor
office
the
pan
american
union
and
other
similar
international
agencies
will
aggregate
about
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
the
administrative
expenses
of
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
international
bank
will
be
met
from
their
general
funds
we
have
won
a
great
warwe
the
nations
of
plain
people
who
hate
war
in
the
test
of
that
war
we
found
a
strength
of
unity
that
brought
us
througha
strength
that
crushed
the
power
of
those
who
sought
by
force
to
deny
our
faith
in
the
dignity
of
man
during
this
trial
the
voices
of
disunity
among
us
were
silent
or
were
subdued
to
an
occasional
whine
that
warned
us
that
they
were
still
among
us
those
voices
are
beginning
to
cry
aloud
again
we
must
learn
constantly
to
turn
deaf
ears
to
them
they
are
voices
which
foster
fear
and
suspicion
and
intolerance
and
hate
they
seek
to
destroy
our
harmony
our
understanding
of
each
other
our
american
tradition
of
live
and
let
live
they
have
become
busy
again
trying
to
set
race
against
race
creed
against
creed
farmer
against
city
dweller
worker
against
employer
people
against
their
own
governments
they
seek
only
to
do
us
mischief
they
must
not
prevail
it
should
be
impossible
for
any
man
to
contemplate
without
a
sense
of
personal
humility
the
tremendous
events
of
the
months
since
the
last
annual
message
the
great
tasks
that
confront
us
the
new
and
huge
problems
of
the
coming
months
and
years
yet
these
very
things
justify
the
deepest
confidence
in
the
future
of
this
nation
of
free
men
and
women
the
plain
people
of
this
country
found
the
courage
and
the
strength
the
selfdiscipline
and
the
mutual
respect
to
fight
and
to
win
with
the
help
of
our
allies
under
god
i
doubt
if
the
tasks
of
the
future
are
more
difficult
but
if
they
are
then
i
say
that
our
strength
and
our
knowledge
and
our
understanding
will
be
equal
to
those
tasks
