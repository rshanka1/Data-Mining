fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
i
congratulate
you
and
our
common
constituency
upon
the
favorable
auspices
under
which
you
meet
for
your
first
session
our
country
is
at
peace
with
all
the
world
the
agitation
which
for
a
time
threatened
to
disturb
the
fraternal
relations
which
make
us
one
people
is
fast
subsiding
and
a
year
of
general
prosperity
and
health
has
crowned
the
nation
with
unusual
blessings
none
can
look
back
to
the
dangers
which
are
passed
or
forward
to
the
bright
prospect
before
us
without
feeling
a
thrill
of
gratification
at
the
same
time
that
he
must
be
impressed
with
a
grateful
sense
of
our
profound
obligations
to
a
beneficent
providence
whose
paternal
care
is
so
manifest
in
the
happiness
of
this
highly
favored
land
since
the
close
of
the
last
congress
certain
cubans
and
other
foreigners
resident
in
the
united
states
who
were
more
or
less
concerned
in
the
previous
invasion
of
cuba
instead
of
being
discouraged
by
its
failure
have
again
abused
the
hospitality
of
this
country
by
making
it
the
scene
of
the
equipment
of
another
military
expedition
against
that
possession
of
her
catholic
majesty
in
which
they
were
countenanced
aided
and
joined
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
on
receiving
intelligence
that
such
designs
were
entertained
i
lost
no
time
in
issuing
such
instructions
to
the
proper
officers
of
the
united
states
as
seemed
to
be
called
for
by
the
occasion
by
the
proclamation
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
submitted
i
also
warned
those
who
might
be
in
danger
of
being
inveigled
into
this
scheme
of
its
unlawful
character
and
of
the
penalties
which
they
would
incur
for
some
time
there
was
reason
to
hope
that
these
measures
had
sufficed
to
prevent
any
such
attempt
this
hope
however
proved
to
be
delusive
very
early
in
the
morning
of
the
d
of
august
a
steamer
called
the
pampero
departed
from
new
orleans
for
cuba
having
on
board
upward
of
armed
men
with
evident
intentions
to
make
war
upon
the
authorities
of
the
island
this
expedition
was
set
on
foot
in
palpable
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
its
leader
was
a
spaniard
and
several
of
the
chief
officers
and
some
others
engaged
in
it
were
foreigners
the
persons
composing
it
however
were
mostly
citizens
of
the
united
states
before
the
expedition
set
out
and
probably
before
it
was
organized
a
slight
insurrectionary
movement
which
appears
to
have
been
soon
suppressed
had
taken
place
in
the
eastern
quarter
of
cuba
the
importance
of
this
movement
was
unfortunately
so
much
exaggerated
in
the
accounts
of
it
published
in
this
country
that
these
adventurers
seem
to
have
been
led
to
believe
that
the
creole
population
of
the
island
not
only
desired
to
throw
off
the
authority
of
the
mother
country
but
had
resolved
upon
that
step
and
had
begun
a
wellconcerted
enterprise
for
effecting
it
the
persons
engaged
in
the
expedition
were
generally
young
and
ill
informed
the
steamer
in
which
they
embarked
left
new
orleans
stealthily
and
without
a
clearance
after
touching
at
key
west
she
proceeded
to
the
coast
of
cuba
and
on
the
night
between
the
th
and
th
of
august
landed
the
persons
on
board
at
playtas
within
about
leagues
of
havana
the
main
body
of
them
proceeded
to
and
took
possession
of
an
inland
village
leagues
distant
leaving
others
to
follow
in
charge
of
the
baggage
as
soon
as
the
means
of
transportation
could
be
obtained
the
latter
having
taken
up
their
line
of
march
to
connect
themselves
with
the
main
body
and
having
proceeded
about
leagues
into
the
country
were
attacked
on
the
morning
of
the
th
by
a
body
of
spanish
troops
and
a
bloody
conflict
ensued
after
which
they
retreated
to
the
place
of
disembarkation
where
about
of
them
obtained
boats
and
reembarked
therein
they
were
however
intercepted
among
the
keys
near
the
shore
by
a
spanish
steamer
cruising
on
the
coast
captured
and
carried
to
havana
and
after
being
examined
before
a
military
court
were
sentenced
to
be
publicly
executed
and
the
sentence
was
carried
into
effect
on
the
th
of
august
on
receiving
information
of
what
had
occurred
commodore
foxhall
a
parker
was
instructed
to
proceed
in
the
steam
frigate
saranac
to
havana
and
inquire
into
the
charges
against
the
persons
executed
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
taken
and
whatsoever
referred
to
their
trial
and
sentence
copies
of
the
instructions
from
the
department
of
state
to
him
and
of
his
letters
to
that
department
are
herewith
submitted
according
to
the
record
of
the
examination
the
prisoners
all
admitted
the
offenses
charged
against
them
of
being
hostile
invaders
of
the
island
at
the
time
of
their
trial
and
execution
the
main
body
of
the
invaders
was
still
in
the
field
making
war
upon
the
spanish
authorities
and
spanish
subjects
after
the
lapse
of
some
days
being
overcome
by
the
spanish
troops
they
dispersed
on
the
th
of
august
lopez
their
leader
was
captured
some
days
after
and
executed
on
the
st
of
september
many
of
his
remaining
followers
were
killed
or
died
of
hunger
and
fatigue
and
the
rest
were
made
prisoners
of
these
none
appear
to
have
been
tried
or
executed
several
of
them
were
pardoned
upon
application
of
their
friends
and
others
and
the
rest
about
in
number
were
sent
to
spain
of
the
final
disposition
made
of
these
we
have
no
official
information
such
is
the
melancholy
result
of
this
illegal
and
illfated
expedition
thus
thoughtless
young
men
have
been
induced
by
false
and
fraudulent
representations
to
violate
the
law
of
their
country
through
rash
and
unfounded
expectations
of
assisting
to
accomplish
political
revolutions
in
other
states
and
have
lost
their
lives
in
the
undertaking
too
severe
a
judgment
can
hardly
be
passed
by
the
indignant
sense
of
the
community
upon
those
who
being
better
informed
themselves
have
yet
led
away
the
ardor
of
youth
and
an
illdirected
love
of
political
liberty
the
correspondence
between
this
government
and
that
of
spain
relating
to
this
transaction
is
herewith
communicated
although
these
offenders
against
the
laws
have
forfeited
the
protection
of
their
country
yet
the
government
may
so
far
as
consistent
with
its
obligations
to
other
countries
and
its
fixed
purpose
to
maintain
and
enforce
the
laws
entertain
sympathy
for
their
unoffending
families
and
friends
as
well
as
a
feeling
of
compassion
for
themselves
accordingly
no
proper
effort
has
been
spared
and
none
will
be
spared
to
procure
the
release
of
such
citizens
of
the
united
states
engaged
in
this
unlawful
enterprise
as
are
now
in
confinement
in
spain
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
such
interposition
with
the
government
of
that
country
may
not
be
considered
as
affording
any
ground
of
expectation
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
will
hereafter
feel
itself
under
any
obligation
of
duty
to
intercede
for
the
liberation
or
pardon
of
such
persons
as
are
flagrant
offenders
against
the
law
of
nations
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
these
laws
must
be
executed
if
we
desire
to
maintain
our
respectability
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
it
behooves
us
to
enforce
steadily
and
sternly
the
neutrality
acts
passed
by
congress
and
to
follow
as
far
as
may
be
the
violation
of
those
acts
with
condign
punishment
but
what
gives
a
peculiar
criminality
to
this
invasion
of
cuba
is
that
under
the
lead
of
spanish
subjects
and
with
the
aid
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
it
had
its
origin
with
many
in
motives
of
cupidity
money
was
advanced
by
individuals
probably
in
considerable
amounts
to
purchase
cuban
bonds
as
they
have
been
called
issued
by
lopez
sold
doubtless
at
a
very
large
discount
and
for
the
payment
of
which
the
public
lands
and
public
property
of
cuba
of
whatever
kind
and
the
fiscal
resources
of
the
people
and
government
of
that
island
from
whatever
source
to
be
derived
were
pledged
as
well
as
the
good
faith
of
the
government
expected
to
be
established
all
these
means
of
payment
it
is
evident
were
only
to
be
obtained
by
a
process
of
bloodshed
war
and
revolution
none
will
deny
that
those
who
set
on
foot
military
expeditions
against
foreign
states
by
means
like
these
are
far
more
culpable
than
the
ignorant
and
the
necessitous
whom
they
induce
to
go
forth
as
the
ostensible
parties
in
the
proceeding
these
originators
of
the
invasion
of
cuba
seem
to
have
determined
with
coolness
and
system
upon
an
undertaking
which
should
disgrace
their
country
violate
its
laws
and
put
to
hazard
the
lives
of
illinformed
and
deluded
men
you
will
consider
whether
further
legislation
be
necessary
to
prevent
the
perpetration
of
such
offenses
in
future
no
individuals
have
a
right
to
hazard
the
peace
of
the
country
or
to
violate
its
laws
upon
vague
notions
of
altering
or
reforming
governments
in
other
states
this
principle
is
not
only
reasonable
in
itself
and
in
accordance
with
public
law
but
is
ingrafted
into
the
codes
of
other
nations
as
well
as
our
own
but
while
such
are
the
sentiments
of
this
government
it
may
be
added
that
every
independent
nation
must
be
presumed
to
be
able
to
defend
its
possessions
against
unauthorized
individuals
banded
together
to
attack
them
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
all
times
since
its
establishment
has
abstained
and
has
sought
to
restrain
the
citizens
of
the
country
from
entering
into
controversies
between
other
powers
and
to
observe
all
the
duties
of
neutrality
at
an
early
period
of
the
government
in
the
administration
of
washington
several
laws
were
passed
for
this
purpose
the
main
provisions
of
these
laws
were
reenacted
by
the
act
of
april
by
which
amongst
other
things
it
was
declared
that
if
any
person
shall
within
the
territory
or
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
begin
or
set
on
foot
or
provide
or
prepare
the
means
for
any
military
expedition
or
enterprise
to
be
carried
on
from
thence
against
the
territory
or
dominions
of
any
foreign
prince
or
state
or
of
any
colony
district
or
people
with
whom
the
united
states
are
at
peace
every
person
so
offending
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
high
misdemeanor
and
shall
be
fined
not
exceeding
and
imprisoned
not
more
than
three
years
and
this
law
has
been
executed
and
enforced
to
the
full
extent
of
the
power
of
the
government
from
that
day
to
this
in
proclaiming
and
adhering
to
the
doctrine
of
neutrality
and
nonintervention
the
united
states
have
not
followed
the
lead
of
other
civilized
nations
they
have
taken
the
lead
themselves
and
have
been
followed
by
others
this
was
admitted
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
modern
british
statesmen
who
said
in
parliament
while
a
minister
of
the
crown
that
if
he
wished
for
a
guide
in
a
system
of
neutrality
he
should
take
that
laid
down
by
america
in
the
days
of
washington
and
the
secretaryship
of
jefferson
and
we
see
in
fact
that
the
act
of
congress
of
was
followed
the
succeeding
year
by
an
act
of
the
parliament
of
england
substantially
the
same
in
its
general
provisions
up
to
that
time
there
had
been
no
similar
law
in
england
except
certain
highly
penal
statutes
passed
in
the
reign
of
george
ii
prohibiting
english
subjects
from
enlisting
in
foreign
service
the
avowed
object
of
which
statutes
was
that
foreign
armies
raised
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
the
house
of
stuart
to
the
throne
should
not
be
strengthened
by
recruits
from
england
herself
all
must
see
that
difficulties
may
arise
in
carrying
the
laws
referred
to
into
execution
in
a
country
now
having
or
miles
of
seacoast
with
an
infinite
number
of
ports
and
harbors
and
small
inlets
from
some
of
which
unlawful
expeditious
may
suddenly
set
forth
without
the
knowledge
of
government
against
the
possessions
of
foreign
states
friendly
relations
with
all
but
entangling
alliances
with
none
has
long
been
a
maxim
with
us
our
true
mission
is
not
to
propagate
our
opinions
or
impose
upon
other
countries
our
form
of
government
by
artifice
or
force
but
to
teach
by
example
and
show
by
our
success
moderation
and
justice
the
blessings
of
selfgovernment
and
the
advantages
of
free
institutions
let
every
people
choose
for
itself
and
make
and
alter
its
political
institutions
to
suit
its
own
condition
and
convenience
but
while
we
avow
and
maintain
this
neutral
policy
ourselves
we
are
anxious
to
see
the
same
forbearance
on
the
part
of
other
nations
whose
forms
of
government
are
different
from
our
own
the
deep
interest
which
we
feel
in
the
spread
of
liberal
principles
and
the
establishment
of
free
governments
and
the
sympathy
with
which
we
witness
every
struggle
against
oppression
forbid
that
we
should
be
indifferent
to
a
case
in
which
the
strong
arm
of
a
foreign
power
is
invoked
to
stifle
public
sentiment
and
repress
the
spirit
of
freedom
in
any
country
the
governments
of
great
britain
and
france
have
issued
orders
to
their
naval
commanders
on
the
west
india
station
to
prevent
by
force
if
necessary
the
landing
of
adventurers
from
any
nation
on
the
island
of
cuba
with
hostile
intent
the
copy
of
a
memorandum
of
a
conversation
on
this
subject
between
the
charge
daffaires
of
her
britannic
majesty
and
the
acting
secretary
of
state
and
of
a
subsequent
note
of
the
former
to
the
department
of
state
are
herewith
submitted
together
with
a
copy
of
a
note
of
the
acting
secretary
of
state
to
the
minister
of
the
french
republic
and
of
the
reply
of
the
latter
on
the
same
subject
these
papers
will
acquaint
you
with
the
grounds
of
this
interposition
of
two
leading
commercial
powers
of
europe
and
with
the
apprehensions
which
this
government
could
not
fail
to
entertain
that
such
interposition
if
carried
into
effect
might
lead
to
abuses
in
derogation
of
the
maritime
rights
of
the
united
states
the
maritime
rights
of
the
united
states
are
founded
on
a
firm
secure
and
welldefined
basis
they
stand
upon
the
ground
of
national
independence
and
public
law
and
will
be
maintained
in
all
their
full
and
just
extent
the
principle
which
this
government
has
heretofore
solemnly
announced
it
still
adheres
to
and
will
maintain
under
all
circumstances
and
at
all
hazards
that
principle
is
that
in
every
regularly
documented
merchant
vessel
the
crew
who
navigate
it
and
those
on
board
of
it
will
find
their
protection
in
the
flag
which
is
over
them
no
american
ship
can
be
allowed
to
be
visited
or
searched
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
character
of
individuals
on
board
nor
can
there
be
allowed
any
watch
by
the
vessels
of
any
foreign
nation
over
american
vessels
on
the
coast
of
the
united
states
or
the
seas
adjacent
thereto
it
will
be
seen
by
the
last
communication
from
the
british
charge
daffaires
to
the
department
of
state
that
he
is
authorized
to
assure
the
secretary
of
state
that
every
care
will
be
taken
that
in
executing
the
preventive
measures
against
the
expeditions
which
the
united
states
government
itself
has
denounced
as
not
being
entitled
to
the
protection
of
any
government
no
interference
shall
take
place
with
the
lawful
commerce
of
any
nation
in
addition
to
the
correspondence
on
this
subject
herewith
submitted
official
information
has
been
received
at
the
department
of
state
of
assurances
by
the
french
government
that
in
the
orders
given
to
the
french
naval
forces
they
were
expressly
instructed
in
any
operations
they
might
engage
in
to
respect
the
flag
of
the
united
states
wherever
it
might
appear
and
to
commit
no
act
of
hostility
upon
any
vessel
or
armament
under
its
protection
ministers
and
consuls
of
foreign
nations
are
the
means
and
agents
of
communication
between
us
and
those
nations
and
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
while
residing
in
the
country
they
should
feel
a
perfect
security
so
long
as
they
faithfully
discharge
their
respective
duties
and
are
guilty
of
no
violation
of
our
laws
this
is
the
admitted
law
of
nations
and
no
country
has
a
deeper
interest
in
maintaining
it
than
the
united
states
our
commerce
spreads
over
every
sea
and
visits
every
clime
and
our
ministers
and
consuls
are
appointed
to
protect
the
interests
of
that
commerce
as
well
as
to
guard
the
peace
of
the
country
and
maintain
the
honor
of
its
flag
but
how
can
they
discharge
these
duties
unless
they
be
themselves
protected
and
if
protected
it
must
be
by
the
laws
of
the
country
in
which
they
reside
and
what
is
due
to
our
own
public
functionaries
residing
in
foreign
nations
is
exactly
the
measure
of
what
is
due
to
the
functionaries
of
other
governments
residing
here
as
in
war
the
bearers
of
flags
of
truce
are
sacred
or
else
wars
would
be
interminable
so
in
peace
ambassadors
public
ministers
and
consuls
charged
with
friendly
national
intercourse
are
objects
of
especial
respect
and
protection
each
according
to
the
rights
belonging
to
his
rank
and
station
in
view
of
these
important
principles
it
is
with
deep
mortification
and
regret
i
announce
to
you
that
during
the
excitement
growing
out
of
the
executions
at
havana
the
office
of
her
catholic
majestys
consul
at
new
orleans
was
assailed
by
a
mob
his
property
destroyed
the
spanish
flag
found
in
the
office
carried
off
and
torn
in
pieces
and
he
himself
induced
to
flee
for
his
personal
safety
which
he
supposed
to
be
in
danger
on
receiving
intelligence
of
these
events
i
forthwith
directed
the
attorney
of
the
united
states
residing
at
new
orleans
to
inquire
into
the
facts
and
the
extent
of
the
pecuniary
loss
sustained
by
the
consul
with
the
intention
of
laying
them
before
you
that
you
might
make
provision
for
such
indemnity
to
him
as
a
just
regard
for
the
honor
of
the
nation
and
the
respect
which
is
due
to
a
friendly
power
might
in
your
judgment
seem
to
require
the
correspondence
upon
this
subject
between
the
secretary
of
state
and
her
catholic
majestys
minister
plenipotentiary
is
herewith
transmitted
the
occurrence
at
new
orleans
has
led
me
to
give
my
attention
to
the
state
of
our
laws
in
regard
to
foreign
ambassadors
ministers
and
consuls
i
think
the
legislation
of
the
country
is
deficient
in
not
providing
sufficiently
either
for
the
protection
or
the
punishment
of
consuls
i
therefore
recommend
the
subject
to
the
consideration
of
congress
your
attention
is
again
invited
to
the
question
of
reciprocal
trade
between
the
united
states
and
canada
and
other
british
possessions
near
our
frontier
overtures
for
a
convention
upon
this
subject
have
been
received
from
her
britannic
majestys
minister
plenipotentiary
but
it
seems
to
be
in
many
respects
preferable
that
the
matter
should
be
regulated
by
reciprocal
legislation
documents
are
laid
before
you
showing
the
terms
which
the
british
government
is
willing
to
offer
and
the
measures
which
it
may
adopt
if
some
arrangement
upon
this
subject
shall
not
be
made
from
the
accompanying
copy
of
a
note
from
the
british
legation
at
washington
and
the
reply
of
the
department
of
state
thereto
it
will
appear
that
her
britannic
majestys
government
is
desirous
that
a
part
of
the
boundary
line
between
oregon
and
the
british
possessions
should
be
authoritatively
marked
out
and
that
an
intention
was
expressed
to
apply
to
congress
for
an
appropriation
to
defray
the
expense
thereof
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
your
attention
to
this
subject
is
accordingly
invited
and
a
proper
appropriation
recommended
a
convention
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
portugal
has
been
concluded
and
the
ratifications
have
been
exchanged
the
first
installment
of
the
amount
to
be
paid
by
portugal
fell
due
on
the
th
of
september
last
and
has
been
paid
the
president
of
the
french
republic
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
convention
has
been
selected
as
arbiter
in
the
case
of
the
general
armstrong
and
has
signified
that
he
accepts
the
trust
and
the
high
satisfaction
he
feels
in
acting
as
the
common
friend
of
two
nations
with
which
france
is
united
by
sentiments
of
sincere
and
lasting
amity
the
turkish
government
has
expressed
its
thanks
for
the
kind
reception
given
to
the
sultans
agent
amin
bey
on
the
occasion
of
his
recent
visit
to
the
united
states
on
the
th
of
february
last
a
dispatch
was
addressed
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
mr
marsh
the
american
minister
at
constantinople
instructing
him
to
ask
of
the
turkish
government
permission
for
the
hungarians
then
imprisoned
within
the
dominions
of
the
sublime
porte
to
remove
to
this
country
on
the
d
of
march
last
both
houses
of
congress
passed
a
resolution
requesting
the
president
to
authorize
the
employment
of
a
public
vessel
to
convey
to
this
country
louis
kossuth
and
his
associates
in
captivity
the
instruction
above
referred
to
was
complied
with
and
the
turkish
government
having
released
governor
kossuth
and
his
companions
from
prison
on
the
th
of
september
last
they
embarked
on
board
of
the
united
states
steam
frigate
mississippi
which
was
selected
to
carry
into
effect
the
resolution
of
congress
governor
kossuth
left
the
mississippi
at
gibraltar
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
visit
to
england
and
may
shortly
be
expected
in
new
york
by
communications
to
the
department
of
state
he
has
expressed
his
grateful
acknowledgments
for
the
interposition
of
this
government
in
behalf
of
himself
and
his
associates
this
country
has
been
justly
regarded
as
a
safe
asylum
for
those
whom
political
events
have
exiled
from
their
own
homes
in
europe
and
it
is
recommended
to
congress
to
consider
in
what
manner
governor
kossuth
and
his
companions
brought
hither
by
its
authority
shall
be
received
and
treated
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
the
differences
which
have
for
some
time
past
been
pending
between
the
government
of
the
french
republic
and
that
of
the
sandwich
islands
may
be
peaceably
and
durably
adjusted
so
as
to
secure
the
independence
of
those
islands
long
before
the
events
which
have
of
late
imparted
so
much
importance
to
the
possessions
of
the
united
states
on
the
pacific
we
acknowledged
the
independence
of
the
hawaiian
government
this
government
was
first
in
taking
that
step
and
several
of
the
leading
powers
of
europe
immediately
followed
we
were
influenced
in
this
measure
by
the
existing
and
prospective
importance
of
the
islands
as
a
place
of
refuge
and
refreshment
for
our
vessels
engaged
in
the
whale
fishery
and
by
the
consideration
that
they
lie
in
the
course
of
the
great
trade
which
must
at
no
distant
day
be
carried
on
between
the
western
coast
of
north
america
and
eastern
asia
we
were
also
influenced
by
a
desire
that
those
islands
should
not
pass
under
the
control
of
any
other
great
maritime
state
but
should
remain
in
an
independent
condition
and
so
be
accessible
and
useful
to
the
commerce
of
all
nations
i
need
not
say
that
the
importance
of
these
considerations
has
been
greatly
enhanced
by
the
sudden
and
vast
development
which
the
interests
of
the
united
states
have
attained
in
california
and
oregon
and
the
policy
heretofore
adopted
in
regard
to
those
islands
will
be
steadily
pursued
it
is
gratifying
not
only
to
those
who
consider
the
commercial
interests
of
nations
but
also
to
all
who
favor
the
progress
of
knowledge
and
the
diffusion
of
religion
to
see
a
community
emerge
from
a
savage
state
and
attain
such
a
degree
of
civilization
in
those
distant
seas
it
is
much
to
be
deplored
that
the
internal
tranquility
of
the
mexican
republic
should
again
be
seriously
disturbed
for
since
the
peace
between
that
republic
and
the
united
states
it
had
enjoyed
such
comparative
repose
that
the
most
favorable
anticipations
for
the
future
might
with
a
degree
of
confidence
have
been
indulged
these
however
have
been
thwarted
by
the
recent
outbreak
in
the
state
of
tamaulipas
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rio
bravo
having
received
information
that
persons
from
the
united
states
had
taken
part
in
the
insurrection
and
apprehending
that
their
example
might
be
followed
by
others
i
caused
orders
to
be
issued
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
hostile
expeditions
against
mexico
from
being
set
on
foot
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
i
likewise
issued
a
proclamation
upon
the
subject
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
laid
before
you
this
appeared
to
be
rendered
imperative
by
the
obligations
of
treaties
and
the
general
duties
of
good
neighborhood
in
my
last
annual
message
i
informed
congress
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
had
undertaken
the
connection
of
the
two
oceans
by
means
of
a
railroad
across
the
isthmus
of
tehuantepec
under
a
grant
of
the
mexican
government
to
a
citizen
of
that
republic
and
that
this
enterprise
would
probably
be
prosecuted
with
energy
whenever
mexico
should
consent
to
such
stipulations
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
should
impart
a
feeling
of
security
to
those
who
should
invest
their
property
in
the
enterprise
a
convention
between
the
two
governments
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
end
has
been
ratified
by
this
government
and
only
awaits
the
decision
of
the
congress
and
the
executive
of
that
republic
some
unexpected
difficulties
and
delays
have
arisen
in
the
ratification
of
that
convention
by
mexico
but
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
her
decision
will
be
governed
by
just
and
enlightened
views
as
well
of
the
general
importance
of
the
object
as
of
her
own
interests
and
obligations
in
negotiating
upon
this
important
subject
this
government
has
had
in
view
one
and
only
one
object
that
object
has
been
and
is
the
construction
or
attainment
of
a
passage
from
ocean
to
ocean
the
shortest
and
the
best
for
travelers
and
merchandise
and
equally
open
to
all
the
world
it
has
sought
to
obtain
no
territorial
acquisition
nor
any
advantages
peculiar
to
itself
and
it
would
see
with
the
greatest
regret
that
mexico
should
oppose
any
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
an
enterprise
which
promises
so
much
convenience
to
the
whole
commercial
world
and
such
eminent
advantages
to
mexico
herself
impressed
with
these
sentiments
and
these
convictions
the
government
will
continue
to
exert
all
proper
efforts
to
bring
about
the
necessary
arrangement
with
the
republic
of
mexico
for
the
speedy
completion
of
the
work
for
some
months
past
the
republic
of
nicaragua
has
been
the
theater
of
one
of
those
civil
convulsions
from
which
the
cause
of
free
institutions
and
the
general
prosperity
and
social
progress
of
the
states
of
central
america
have
so
often
and
so
severely
suffered
until
quiet
shall
have
been
restored
and
a
government
apparently
stable
shall
have
been
organized
no
advance
can
prudently
be
made
in
disposing
of
the
questions
pending
between
the
two
countries
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
an
interoceanic
communication
from
the
mouth
of
the
st
john
to
the
pacific
has
been
so
far
accomplished
as
that
passengers
have
actually
traversed
it
and
merchandise
has
been
transported
over
it
and
when
the
canal
shall
have
been
completed
according
to
the
original
plan
the
means
of
communication
will
be
further
improved
it
is
understood
that
a
considerable
part
of
the
railroad
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
has
been
completed
and
that
the
mail
and
passengers
will
in
future
be
conveyed
thereon
whichever
of
the
several
routes
between
the
two
oceans
may
ultimately
prove
most
eligible
for
travelers
to
and
from
the
different
states
on
the
atlantic
and
gulf
of
mexico
and
our
coast
on
the
pacific
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
all
of
them
will
be
useful
to
the
public
and
will
liberally
reward
that
individual
enterprise
by
which
alone
they
have
been
or
are
expected
to
be
carried
into
effect
peace
has
been
concluded
between
the
contending
parties
in
the
island
of
st
domingo
and
it
is
hoped
upon
a
durable
basis
such
is
the
extent
of
our
commercial
relations
with
that
island
that
the
united
states
can
not
fail
to
feel
a
strong
interest
in
its
tranquility
the
office
of
commissioner
to
china
remains
unfilled
several
persons
have
been
appointed
and
the
place
has
been
offered
to
others
all
of
whom
have
declined
its
acceptance
on
the
ground
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
compensation
the
annual
allowance
by
law
is
and
there
is
no
provision
for
any
outfit
i
earnestly
recommend
the
consideration
of
this
subject
to
congress
our
commerce
with
china
is
highly
important
and
is
becoming
more
and
more
so
in
consequence
of
the
increasing
intercourse
between
our
ports
on
the
pacific
coast
and
eastern
asia
china
is
understood
to
be
a
country
in
which
living
is
very
expensive
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
the
american
commissioner
sent
thither
should
not
be
placed
in
regard
to
compensation
on
an
equal
footing
with
ministers
who
represent
this
country
at
the
courts
of
europe
by
reference
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
will
be
seen
that
the
aggregate
receipts
for
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
which
with
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
july
gave
as
the
available
means
for
the
year
the
sum
of
the
total
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
the
total
imports
for
the
year
ending
june
were
of
which
there
were
in
specie
the
exports
for
the
same
period
were
of
which
there
were
of
domestic
products
foreign
goods
reexported
specie
since
the
st
of
december
last
the
payments
in
cash
on
account
of
the
public
debt
exclusive
of
interest
have
amounted
to
which
however
includes
the
sum
of
paid
under
the
twelfth
article
of
the
treaty
with
mexico
and
the
further
sum
of
being
the
amount
of
awards
to
american
citizens
under
the
late
treaty
with
mexico
for
which
the
issue
of
stock
was
authorized
but
which
was
paid
in
cash
from
the
treasury
the
public
debt
on
the
th
ultimo
exclusive
of
the
stock
authorized
to
be
issued
to
texas
by
the
act
of
th
september
was
the
receipts
for
the
next
fiscal
year
are
estimated
at
which
with
the
probable
unappropriated
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
th
june
next
will
give
as
the
probable
available
means
for
that
year
the
sum
of
it
has
been
deemed
proper
in
view
of
the
large
expenditures
consequent
upon
the
acquisition
of
territory
from
mexico
that
the
estimates
for
the
next
fiscal
year
should
be
laid
before
congress
in
such
manner
as
to
distinguish
the
expenditures
so
required
from
the
otherwise
ordinary
demands
upon
the
treasury
the
total
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
are
estimated
at
of
which
there
is
required
for
the
ordinary
purposes
of
the
government
other
than
those
consequent
upon
the
acquisition
of
our
new
territories
and
deducting
the
payments
on
account
of
the
public
debt
the
sum
of
and
for
the
purposes
connected
directly
or
indirectly
with
those
territories
and
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
obligations
of
the
government
contracted
in
consequence
of
their
acquisition
the
sum
of
if
the
views
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
reference
to
the
expenditures
required
for
these
territories
shall
be
met
by
corresponding
action
on
the
part
of
congress
and
appropriations
made
in
accordance
therewith
there
will
be
an
estimated
unappropriated
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
th
june
of
wherewith
to
meet
that
portion
of
the
public
debt
due
on
the
st
of
july
following
amounting
to
as
well
as
any
appropriations
which
may
be
made
beyond
the
estimates
in
thus
referring
to
the
estimated
expenditures
on
account
of
our
newly
acquired
territories
i
may
express
the
hope
that
congress
will
concur
with
me
in
the
desire
that
a
liberal
course
of
policy
may
be
pursued
toward
them
and
that
every
obligation
express
or
implied
entered
into
in
consequence
of
their
acquisition
shall
be
fulfilled
by
the
most
liberal
appropriations
for
that
purpose
the
values
of
our
domestic
exports
for
the
last
fiscal
year
as
compared
with
those
of
the
previous
year
exhibit
an
increase
of
at
first
view
this
condition
of
our
trade
with
foreign
nations
would
seem
to
present
the
most
flattering
hopes
of
its
future
prosperity
an
examination
of
the
details
of
our
exports
however
will
show
that
the
increased
value
of
our
exports
for
the
last
fiscal
year
is
to
be
found
in
the
high
price
of
cotton
which
prevailed
during
the
first
half
of
that
year
which
price
has
since
declined
about
onehalf
the
value
of
our
exports
of
breadstuffs
and
provisions
which
it
was
supposed
the
incentive
of
a
low
tariff
and
large
importations
from
abroad
would
have
greatly
augmented
has
fallen
from
in
to
in
and
to
in
with
a
strong
probability
amounting
almost
to
a
certainty
of
a
still
further
reduction
in
the
current
year
the
aggregate
values
of
rice
exported
during
the
last
fiscal
year
as
compared
with
the
previous
year
also
exhibit
a
decrease
amounting
to
which
with
a
decline
in
the
values
of
the
exports
of
tobacco
for
the
same
period
make
an
aggregate
decrease
in
these
two
articles
of
the
policy
which
dictated
a
low
rate
of
duties
on
foreign
merchandise
it
was
thought
by
those
who
promoted
and
established
it
would
tend
to
benefit
the
farming
population
of
this
country
by
increasing
the
demand
and
raising
the
price
of
agricultural
products
in
foreign
markets
the
foregoing
facts
however
seem
to
show
incontestably
that
no
such
result
has
followed
the
adoption
of
this
policy
on
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
repeal
of
the
restrictive
corn
laws
in
england
the
foreign
demand
for
the
products
of
the
american
farmer
has
steadily
declined
since
the
short
crops
and
consequent
famine
in
a
portion
of
europe
have
been
happily
replaced
by
full
crops
and
comparative
abundance
of
food
it
will
be
seen
by
recurring
to
the
commercial
statistics
for
the
past
year
that
the
value
of
our
domestic
exports
has
been
increased
in
the
single
item
of
raw
cotton
by
over
the
value
of
that
export
for
the
year
preceding
this
is
not
due
to
any
increased
general
demand
for
that
article
but
to
the
short
crop
of
the
preceding
year
which
created
an
increased
demand
and
an
augmented
price
for
the
crop
of
last
year
should
the
cotton
crop
now
going
forward
to
market
be
only
equal
in
quantity
to
that
of
the
year
preceding
and
be
sold
at
the
present
prices
then
there
would
be
a
falling
off
in
the
value
of
our
exports
for
the
present
fiscal
year
of
at
least
compared
with
the
amount
exported
for
the
year
ending
th
june
the
production
of
gold
in
california
for
the
past
year
seems
to
promise
a
large
supply
of
that
metal
from
that
quarter
for
some
time
to
come
this
large
annual
increase
of
the
currency
of
the
world
must
be
attended
with
its
usual
results
these
have
been
already
partially
disclosed
in
the
enhancement
of
prices
and
a
rising
spirit
of
speculation
and
adventure
tending
to
overtrading
as
well
at
home
as
abroad
unless
some
salutary
check
shall
be
given
to
these
tendencies
it
is
to
be
feared
that
importations
of
foreign
goods
beyond
a
healthy
demand
in
this
country
will
lead
to
a
sudden
drain
of
the
precious
metals
from
us
bringing
with
it
as
it
has
done
in
former
times
the
most
disastrous
consequences
to
the
business
and
capital
of
the
american
people
the
exports
of
specie
to
liquidate
our
foreign
debt
during
the
past
fiscal
year
have
been
over
the
amount
of
specie
imported
the
exports
of
specie
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
fiscal
year
have
been
should
specie
continue
to
be
exported
at
this
rate
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
of
this
year
it
will
drain
from
our
metallic
currency
during
the
year
ending
th
june
the
enormous
amount
of
in
the
present
prosperous
condition
of
the
national
finances
it
will
become
the
duty
of
congress
to
consider
the
best
mode
of
paying
off
the
public
debt
if
the
present
and
anticipated
surplus
in
the
treasury
should
not
be
absorbed
by
appropriations
of
an
extraordinary
character
this
surplus
should
be
employed
in
such
way
and
under
such
restrictions
as
congress
may
enact
in
extinguishing
the
outstanding
debt
of
the
nation
by
reference
to
the
act
of
congress
approved
th
september
it
will
be
seen
that
in
consideration
of
certain
concessions
by
the
state
of
texas
it
is
provided
that
the
united
states
shall
pay
to
the
state
of
texas
the
sum
of
in
a
stock
bearing
per
cent
interest
and
redeemable
at
the
end
of
fourteen
years
the
interest
payable
halfyearly
at
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
in
the
same
section
of
the
law
it
is
further
provided
that
no
more
than
five
millions
of
said
stock
shall
be
issued
until
the
creditors
of
the
state
holding
bonds
and
other
certificates
of
stock
of
texas
for
which
duties
on
imports
were
specially
pledged
shall
first
file
at
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
releases
of
all
claims
against
the
united
states
for
or
on
account
of
said
bonds
or
certificates
in
such
form
as
shall
be
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
approved
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
form
of
release
thus
provided
for
has
been
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
approved
it
has
been
published
in
all
the
leading
newspapers
in
the
commercial
cities
of
the
united
states
and
all
persons
holding
claims
of
the
kind
specified
in
the
foregoing
proviso
were
required
to
file
their
releases
in
the
form
thus
prescribed
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
on
or
before
the
st
day
of
october
although
this
publication
has
been
continued
from
the
th
day
of
march
yet
up
to
the
st
of
october
last
comparatively
few
releases
had
been
filed
by
the
creditors
of
texas
the
authorities
of
the
state
of
texas
at
the
request
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
have
furnished
a
schedule
of
the
public
debt
of
that
state
created
prior
to
her
admission
into
the
union
with
a
copy
of
the
laws
under
which
each
class
was
contracted
i
have
from
the
documents
furnished
by
the
state
of
texas
determined
the
classes
of
claims
which
in
my
judgment
fall
within
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
of
the
th
of
september
on
being
officially
informed
of
the
acceptance
by
texas
of
the
propositions
contained
in
the
act
referred
to
i
caused
the
stock
to
be
prepared
and
the
five
millions
which
are
to
be
issued
unconditionally
bearing
an
interest
of
per
cent
from
the
st
day
of
january
have
been
for
some
time
ready
to
be
delivered
to
the
state
of
texas
the
authorities
of
texas
up
to
the
present
time
have
not
authorized
anyone
to
receive
this
stock
and
it
remains
in
the
treasury
department
subject
to
the
order
of
texas
the
releases
required
by
law
to
be
deposited
in
the
treasury
not
having
been
filed
there
the
remaining
five
millions
have
not
been
issued
this
last
amount
of
the
stock
will
be
withheld
from
texas
until
the
conditions
upon
which
it
is
to
be
delivered
shall
be
complied
with
by
the
creditors
of
that
state
unless
congress
shall
otherwise
direct
by
a
modification
of
the
law
in
my
last
annual
message
to
which
i
respectfully
refer
i
stated
briefly
the
reasons
which
induced
me
to
recommend
a
modification
of
the
present
tariff
by
converting
the
ad
valorem
into
a
specific
duty
wherever
the
article
imported
was
of
such
a
character
as
to
permit
it
and
that
such
a
discrimination
should
be
made
in
favor
of
the
industrial
pursuits
of
our
own
country
as
to
encourage
home
production
without
excluding
foreign
competition
the
numerous
frauds
which
continue
to
be
practiced
upon
the
revenue
by
false
invoices
and
undervaluations
constitute
an
unanswerable
reason
for
adopting
specific
instead
of
ad
valorem
duties
in
all
cases
where
the
nature
of
the
commodity
does
not
forbid
it
a
striking
illustration
of
these
frauds
will
be
exhibited
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
showing
the
customhouse
valuation
of
articles
imported
under
a
former
law
subject
to
specific
duties
when
there
was
no
inducement
to
undervaluation
and
the
customhouse
valuations
of
the
same
articles
under
the
present
system
of
ad
valorem
duties
so
greatly
reduced
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
the
existence
of
the
most
flagrant
abuses
under
the
existing
laws
this
practical
evasion
of
the
present
law
combined
with
the
languishing
condition
of
some
of
the
great
interests
of
the
country
caused
by
over
importations
and
consequent
depressed
prices
and
with
the
failure
in
obtaining
a
foreign
market
for
our
increasing
surplus
of
breadstuffs
and
provisions
has
induced
me
again
to
recommend
a
modification
of
the
existing
tariff
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
accompanies
this
communication
will
present
a
condensed
statement
of
the
operations
of
that
important
department
of
the
government
it
will
be
seen
that
the
cash
sales
of
the
public
lands
exceed
those
of
the
preceding
year
and
that
there
is
reason
to
anticipate
a
still
further
increase
notwithstanding
the
large
donations
which
have
been
made
to
many
of
the
states
and
the
liberal
grants
to
individuals
as
a
reward
for
military
services
this
fact
furnishes
very
gratifying
evidence
of
the
growing
wealth
and
prosperity
of
our
country
suitable
measures
have
been
adopted
for
commencing
the
survey
of
the
public
lands
in
california
and
oregon
surveying
parties
have
been
organized
and
some
progress
has
been
made
in
establishing
the
principal
base
and
meridian
lines
but
further
legislation
and
additional
appropriations
will
be
necessary
before
the
proper
subdivisions
can
be
made
and
the
general
land
system
extended
over
those
remote
parts
of
our
territory
on
the
d
of
march
last
an
act
was
passed
providing
for
the
appointment
of
three
commissioners
to
settle
private
land
claims
in
california
three
persons
were
immediately
appointed
all
of
whom
however
declined
accepting
the
office
in
consequence
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
compensation
others
were
promptly
selected
who
for
the
same
reason
also
declined
and
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
season
that
the
services
of
suitable
persons
could
be
secured
a
majority
of
the
commissioners
convened
in
this
city
on
the
th
of
september
last
when
detailed
instructions
were
given
to
them
in
regard
to
their
duties
their
first
meeting
for
the
transaction
of
business
will
be
held
in
san
francisco
on
the
th
day
of
the
present
month
i
have
thought
it
proper
to
refer
to
these
facts
not
only
to
explain
the
causes
of
the
delay
in
filling
the
commission
but
to
call
your
attention
to
the
propriety
of
increasing
the
compensation
of
the
commissioners
the
office
is
one
of
great
labor
and
responsibility
and
the
compensation
should
be
such
as
to
command
men
of
a
high
order
of
talents
and
the
most
unquestionable
integrity
the
proper
disposal
of
the
mineral
lands
of
california
is
a
subject
surrounded
by
great
difficulties
in
my
last
annual
message
i
recommended
the
survey
and
sale
of
them
in
small
parcels
under
such
restrictions
as
would
effectually
guard
against
monopoly
and
speculation
but
upon
further
information
and
in
deference
to
the
opinions
of
persons
familiar
with
the
subject
i
am
inclined
to
change
that
recommendation
and
to
advise
that
they
be
permitted
to
remain
as
at
present
a
common
field
open
to
the
enterprise
and
industry
of
all
our
citizens
until
further
experience
shall
have
developed
the
best
policy
to
be
ultimately
adopted
in
regard
to
them
it
is
safer
to
suffer
the
inconveniences
that
now
exist
for
a
short
period
than
by
premature
legislation
to
fasten
on
the
country
a
system
founded
in
error
which
may
place
the
whole
subject
beyond
the
future
control
of
congress
the
agricultural
lands
should
however
be
surveyed
and
brought
into
market
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
that
the
titles
may
become
settled
and
the
inhabitants
stimulated
to
make
permanent
improvements
and
enter
on
the
ordinary
pursuits
of
life
to
effect
these
objects
it
is
desirable
that
the
necessary
provision
be
made
by
law
for
the
establishment
of
land
offices
in
california
and
oregon
and
for
the
efficient
prosecution
of
the
surveys
at
an
early
day
some
difficulties
have
occurred
in
organizing
the
territorial
governments
of
new
mexico
and
utah
and
when
more
accurate
information
shall
be
obtained
of
the
causes
a
further
communication
will
be
made
on
that
subject
in
my
last
annual
communication
to
congress
i
recommended
the
establishment
of
an
agricultural
bureau
and
i
take
this
occasion
again
to
invoke
your
favorable
consideration
of
the
subject
agriculture
may
justly
be
regarded
as
the
great
interest
of
our
people
fourfifths
of
our
active
population
are
employed
in
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
and
the
rapid
expansion
of
our
settlements
over
new
territory
is
daily
adding
to
the
number
of
those
engaged
in
that
vocation
justice
and
sound
policy
therefore
alike
require
that
the
government
should
use
all
the
means
authorized
by
the
constitution
to
promote
the
interests
and
welfare
of
that
important
class
of
our
fellowcitizens
and
yet
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
whilst
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
interests
have
engaged
the
attention
of
congress
during
a
large
portion
of
every
session
and
our
statutes
abound
in
provisions
for
their
protection
and
encouragement
little
has
yet
been
done
directly
for
the
advancement
of
agriculture
it
is
time
that
this
reproach
to
our
legislation
should
be
removed
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
present
congress
will
not
close
their
labors
without
adopting
efficient
means
to
supply
the
omissions
of
those
who
have
preceded
them
an
agricultural
bureau
charged
with
the
duty
of
collecting
and
disseminating
correct
information
as
to
the
best
modes
of
cultivation
and
of
the
most
effectual
means
of
preserving
and
restoring
the
fertility
of
the
soil
and
of
procuring
and
distributing
seeds
and
plants
and
other
vegetable
productions
with
instructions
in
regard
to
the
soil
climate
and
treatment
best
adapted
to
their
growth
could
not
fail
to
be
in
the
language
of
washington
in
his
last
annual
message
to
congress
a
very
cheap
instrument
of
immense
national
benefit
regarding
the
act
of
congress
approved
th
september
granting
bounty
lands
to
persons
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
military
service
of
the
country
as
a
great
measure
of
national
justice
and
munificence
an
anxious
desire
has
been
felt
by
the
officers
intrusted
with
its
immediate
execution
to
give
prompt
effect
to
its
provisions
all
the
means
within
their
control
were
therefore
brought
into
requisition
to
expedite
the
adjudication
of
claims
and
i
am
gratified
to
be
able
to
state
that
near
applications
have
been
considered
and
about
warrants
issued
within
the
short
space
of
nine
months
if
adequate
provision
be
made
by
law
to
carry
into
effect
the
recommendations
of
the
department
it
is
confidently
expected
that
before
the
close
of
the
next
fiscal
year
all
who
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
act
will
have
received
their
warrants
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
suggested
in
his
report
various
amendments
of
the
laws
relating
to
pensions
and
bounty
lands
for
the
purpose
of
more
effectually
guarding
against
abuses
and
frauds
on
the
government
to
all
of
which
i
invite
your
particular
attention
the
large
accessions
to
our
indian
population
consequent
upon
the
acquisition
of
new
mexico
and
california
and
the
extension
of
our
settlements
into
utah
and
oregon
have
given
increased
interest
and
importance
to
our
relations
with
the
aboriginal
race
no
material
change
has
taken
place
within
the
last
year
in
the
condition
and
prospects
of
the
indian
tribes
who
reside
in
the
northwestern
territory
and
west
of
the
mississippi
river
we
are
at
peace
with
all
of
them
and
it
will
be
a
source
of
pleasure
to
you
to
learn
that
they
are
gradually
advancing
in
civilization
and
the
pursuits
of
social
life
along
the
mexican
frontier
and
in
california
and
oregon
there
have
been
occasional
manifestations
of
unfriendly
feeling
and
some
depredations
committed
i
am
satisfied
however
that
they
resulted
more
from
the
destitute
and
starving
condition
of
the
indians
than
from
any
settled
hostility
toward
the
whites
as
the
settlements
of
our
citizens
progress
toward
them
the
game
upon
which
they
mainly
rely
for
subsistence
is
driven
off
or
destroyed
and
the
only
alternative
left
to
them
is
starvation
or
plunder
it
becomes
us
to
consider
in
view
of
this
condition
of
things
whether
justice
and
humanity
as
well
as
an
enlightened
economy
do
not
require
that
instead
of
seeking
to
punish
them
for
offenses
which
are
the
result
of
our
own
policy
toward
them
we
should
not
provide
for
their
immediate
wants
and
encourage
them
to
engage
in
agriculture
and
to
rely
on
their
labor
instead
of
the
chase
for
the
means
of
support
various
important
treaties
have
been
negotiated
with
different
tribes
during
the
year
by
which
their
title
to
large
and
valuable
tracts
of
country
has
been
extinguished
all
of
which
will
at
the
proper
time
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
the
joint
commission
under
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
has
been
actively
engaged
in
running
and
marking
the
boundary
line
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
it
was
stated
in
the
last
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
the
initial
point
on
the
pacific
and
the
point
of
junction
of
the
gila
with
the
colorado
river
had
been
determined
and
the
intervening
line
about
miles
in
length
run
and
marked
by
temporary
monuments
since
that
time
a
monument
of
marble
has
been
erected
at
the
initial
point
and
permanent
landmarks
of
iron
have
been
placed
at
suitable
distances
along
the
line
the
initial
point
on
the
rio
grande
has
also
been
fixed
by
the
commissioners
at
latitude
degrees
and
at
the
date
of
the
last
communication
the
survey
of
the
line
had
been
made
thence
westward
about
miles
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
copper
mines
the
commission
on
our
part
was
at
first
organized
on
a
scale
which
experience
proved
to
be
unwieldy
and
attended
with
unnecessary
expense
orders
have
therefore
been
issued
for
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
persons
employed
within
the
smallest
limits
consistent
with
the
safety
of
those
engaged
in
the
service
and
the
prompt
and
efficient
execution
of
their
important
duties
returns
have
been
received
from
all
the
officers
engaged
in
taking
the
census
in
the
states
and
territories
except
california
the
superintendent
employed
to
make
the
enumeration
in
that
state
has
not
yet
made
his
full
report
from
causes
as
he
alleges
beyond
his
control
this
failure
is
much
to
be
regretted
as
it
has
prevented
the
secretary
of
the
interior
from
making
the
decennial
apportionment
of
representatives
among
the
states
as
required
by
the
act
approved
may
it
is
hoped
however
that
the
returns
will
soon
be
received
and
no
time
will
then
be
lost
in
making
the
necessary
apportionment
and
in
transmitting
the
certificates
required
by
law
the
superintendent
of
the
seventh
census
is
diligently
employed
under
the
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
classifying
and
arranging
in
tabular
form
all
the
statistical
information
derived
from
the
returns
of
the
marshals
and
it
is
believed
that
when
the
work
shall
be
completed
it
will
exhibit
a
more
perfect
view
of
the
population
wealth
occupations
and
social
condition
of
a
great
country
than
has
ever
been
presented
to
the
world
the
value
of
such
a
work
as
the
basis
of
enlightened
legislation
can
hardly
be
overestimated
and
i
earnestly
hope
that
congress
will
lose
no
time
in
making
the
appropriations
necessary
to
complete
the
classifications
and
to
publish
the
results
in
a
style
worthy
of
the
subject
and
of
our
national
character
the
want
of
a
uniform
fee
bill
prescribing
the
compensation
to
be
allowed
district
attorneys
clerks
marshals
and
commissioners
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
is
the
cause
of
much
vexation
injustice
and
complaint
i
would
recommend
a
thorough
revision
of
the
laws
on
the
whole
subject
and
the
adoption
of
a
tariff
of
fees
which
as
far
as
practicable
should
be
uniform
and
prescribe
a
specific
compensation
for
every
service
which
the
officer
may
be
required
to
perform
this
subject
will
be
fully
presented
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
my
last
annual
message
i
gave
briefly
my
reasons
for
believing
that
you
possessed
the
constitutional
power
to
improve
the
harbors
of
our
great
lakes
and
seacoast
and
the
navigation
of
our
principal
rivers
and
recommended
that
appropriations
should
be
made
for
completing
such
works
as
had
already
been
commenced
and
for
commencing
such
others
as
might
seem
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
to
be
of
public
and
general
importance
without
repeating
the
reasons
then
urged
i
deem
it
my
duty
again
to
call
your
attention
to
this
important
subject
the
works
on
many
of
the
harbors
were
left
in
an
unfinished
state
and
consequently
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
elements
which
is
fast
destroying
them
great
numbers
of
lives
and
vast
amounts
of
property
are
annually
lost
for
want
of
safe
and
convenient
harbors
on
the
lakes
none
but
those
who
have
been
exposed
to
that
dangerous
navigation
can
fully
appreciate
the
importance
of
this
subject
the
whole
northwest
appeals
to
you
for
relief
and
i
trust
their
appeal
will
receive
due
consideration
at
your
hands
the
same
is
in
a
measure
true
in
regard
to
some
of
the
harbors
and
inlets
on
the
seacoast
the
unobstructed
navigation
of
our
large
rivers
is
of
equal
importance
our
settlements
are
now
extending
to
the
sources
of
the
great
rivers
which
empty
into
and
form
a
part
of
the
mississippi
and
the
value
of
the
public
lands
in
those
regions
would
be
greatly
enhanced
by
freeing
the
navigation
of
those
waters
from
obstructions
in
view
therefore
of
this
great
interest
i
deem
it
my
duty
again
to
urge
upon
congress
to
make
such
appropriations
for
these
improvements
as
they
may
deem
necessary
the
surveys
of
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
with
a
view
to
the
prevention
of
the
overflows
that
have
proved
so
disastrous
to
that
region
of
country
have
been
nearly
completed
and
the
reports
thereof
are
now
in
course
of
preparation
and
will
shortly
be
laid
before
you
the
protection
of
our
southwestern
frontier
and
of
the
adjacent
mexican
states
against
the
indian
tribes
within
our
border
has
claimed
my
earnest
and
constant
attention
congress
having
failed
at
the
last
session
to
adopt
my
recommendation
that
an
additional
regiment
of
mounted
men
specially
adapted
to
that
service
should
be
raised
all
that
remained
to
be
done
was
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
means
at
my
disposal
accordingly
all
the
troops
adapted
to
that
service
that
could
properly
be
spared
from
other
quarters
have
been
concentrated
on
that
frontier
and
officers
of
high
reputation
selected
to
command
them
a
new
arrangement
of
the
military
posts
has
also
been
made
whereby
the
troops
are
brought
nearer
to
the
mexican
frontier
and
to
the
tribes
they
are
intended
to
overawe
sufficient
time
has
not
yet
elapsed
to
realize
all
the
benefits
that
are
expected
to
result
from
these
arrangements
but
i
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
they
will
effectually
check
their
marauding
expeditions
the
nature
of
the
country
which
furnishes
little
for
the
support
of
an
army
and
abounds
in
places
of
refuge
and
concealment
is
remarkably
well
adapted
to
this
predatory
warfare
and
we
can
scarcely
hope
that
any
military
force
combined
with
the
greatest
vigilance
can
entirely
suppress
it
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
we
are
bound
to
protect
the
territory
of
mexico
against
the
incursions
of
the
savage
tribes
within
our
border
with
equal
diligence
and
energy
as
if
the
same
were
made
within
our
territory
or
against
our
citizens
i
have
endeavored
to
comply
as
far
as
possible
with
this
provision
of
the
treaty
orders
have
been
given
to
the
officers
commanding
on
that
frontier
to
consider
the
mexican
territory
and
its
inhabitants
as
equally
with
our
own
entitled
to
their
protection
and
to
make
all
their
plans
and
arrangements
with
a
view
to
the
attainment
of
this
object
instructions
have
also
been
given
to
the
indian
commissioners
and
agents
among
these
tribes
in
all
treaties
to
make
the
clauses
designed
for
the
protection
of
our
own
citizens
apply
also
to
those
of
mexico
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
these
instructions
have
been
fully
carried
into
effect
nevertheless
it
is
probable
that
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
some
of
the
neighboring
states
of
mexico
may
have
suffered
as
our
own
have
from
depredations
by
the
indians
to
the
difficulties
of
defending
our
own
territory
as
above
mentioned
are
superadded
in
defending
that
of
mexico
those
that
arise
from
its
remoteness
from
the
fact
that
we
have
no
right
to
station
our
troops
within
her
limits
and
that
there
is
no
efficient
military
force
on
the
mexican
side
to
cooperate
with
our
own
so
long
as
this
shall
continue
to
be
the
case
the
number
and
activity
of
our
troops
will
rather
increase
than
diminish
the
evil
as
the
indians
will
naturally
turn
toward
that
country
where
they
encounter
the
least
resistance
yet
these
troops
are
necessary
to
subdue
them
and
to
compel
them
to
make
and
observe
treaties
until
this
shall
have
been
done
neither
country
will
enjoy
any
security
from
their
attacks
the
indians
in
california
who
had
previously
appeared
of
a
peaceable
character
and
disposed
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
the
whites
have
recently
committed
several
acts
of
hostility
as
a
large
portion
of
the
reenforcements
sent
to
the
mexican
frontier
were
drawn
from
the
pacific
the
military
force
now
stationed
there
is
considered
entirely
inadequate
to
its
defense
it
can
not
be
increased
however
without
an
increase
of
the
army
and
i
again
recommend
that
measure
as
indispensable
to
the
protection
of
the
frontier
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
suggestions
on
this
subject
and
on
others
connected
with
his
department
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
the
appropriations
for
the
support
of
the
army
during
the
current
fiscal
year
ending
th
june
next
were
reduced
far
below
the
estimate
submitted
by
the
department
the
consequence
of
this
reduction
is
a
considerable
deficiency
to
which
i
invite
your
early
attention
the
expenditures
of
that
department
for
the
year
ending
th
june
last
were
the
estimates
for
the
year
commencing
st
july
next
and
ending
june
are
showing
a
reductions
of
the
board
of
commissioners
to
whom
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
military
asylum
created
by
the
act
of
d
march
last
was
intrusted
have
selected
a
site
for
the
establishment
of
an
asylum
in
the
vicinity
of
this
city
which
has
been
approved
by
me
subject
to
the
production
of
a
satisfactory
title
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
will
exhibit
the
condition
of
the
public
service
under
the
supervision
of
that
department
our
naval
force
afloat
during
the
present
year
has
been
actively
and
usefully
employed
in
giving
protection
to
our
widely
extended
and
increasing
commerce
and
interests
in
the
various
quarters
of
the
globe
and
our
flag
has
everywhere
afforded
the
security
and
received
the
respect
inspired
by
the
justice
and
liberality
of
our
intercourse
and
the
dignity
and
power
of
the
nation
the
expedition
commanded
by
lieutenant
de
haven
dispatched
in
search
of
the
british
commander
sir
john
franklin
and
his
companions
in
the
arctic
seas
returned
to
new
york
in
the
month
of
october
after
having
undergone
great
peril
and
suffering
from
an
unknown
and
dangerous
navigation
and
the
rigors
of
a
northern
climate
without
any
satisfactory
information
of
the
objects
of
their
search
but
with
new
contributions
to
science
and
navigation
from
the
unfrequented
polar
regions
the
officers
and
men
of
the
expedition
having
been
all
volunteers
for
this
service
and
having
so
conducted
it
as
to
meet
the
entire
approbation
of
the
government
it
is
suggested
as
an
act
of
grace
and
generosity
that
the
same
allowance
of
extra
pay
and
emoluments
be
extended
to
them
that
were
made
to
the
officers
and
men
of
like
rating
in
the
late
exploring
expedition
to
the
south
seas
i
earnestly
recommend
to
your
attention
the
necessity
of
reorganizing
the
naval
establishment
apportioning
and
fixing
the
number
of
officers
in
each
grade
providing
some
mode
of
promotion
to
the
higher
grades
of
the
navy
having
reference
to
merit
and
capacity
rather
than
seniority
or
date
of
entry
into
the
service
and
for
retiring
from
the
effective
list
upon
reduced
pay
those
who
may
be
incompetent
to
the
performance
of
active
duty
as
a
measure
of
economy
as
well
as
of
efficiency
in
this
arm
of
the
service
the
provision
last
mentioned
is
eminently
worthy
of
your
consideration
the
determination
of
the
questions
of
relative
rank
between
the
sea
officers
and
civil
officers
of
the
navy
and
between
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
in
the
various
grades
of
each
will
also
merit
your
attention
the
failure
to
provide
any
substitute
when
corporal
punishment
was
abolished
for
offenses
in
the
navy
has
occasioned
the
convening
of
numerous
courtsmartial
upon
the
arrival
of
vessels
in
port
and
is
believed
to
have
had
an
injurious
effect
upon
the
discipline
and
efficiency
of
the
service
to
moderate
punishment
from
one
grade
to
another
is
among
the
humane
reforms
of
the
age
but
to
abolish
one
of
severity
which
applied
so
generally
to
offenses
on
shipboard
and
provide
nothing
in
its
stead
is
to
suppose
a
progress
of
improvement
in
every
individual
among
seamen
which
is
not
assumed
by
the
legislature
in
respect
to
any
other
class
of
men
it
is
hoped
that
congress
in
the
ample
opportunity
afforded
by
the
present
session
will
thoroughly
investigate
this
important
subject
and
establish
such
modes
of
determining
guilt
and
such
gradations
of
punishment
as
are
consistent
with
humanity
and
the
personal
rights
of
individuals
and
at
the
same
time
shall
insure
the
most
energetic
and
efficient
performance
of
duty
and
the
suppression
of
crime
in
our
ships
of
war
the
stone
dock
in
the
navyyard
at
new
york
which
was
ten
years
in
process
of
construction
has
been
so
far
finished
as
to
be
surrendered
up
to
the
authorities
of
the
yard
the
dry
dock
at
philadelphia
is
reported
as
completed
and
is
expected
soon
to
be
tested
and
delivered
over
to
the
agents
of
the
government
that
at
portsmouth
n
h
is
also
nearly
ready
for
delivery
and
a
contract
has
been
concluded
agreeably
to
the
act
of
congress
at
its
last
session
for
a
floating
sectional
dock
on
the
bay
of
san
francisco
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
department
touching
the
establishment
of
a
navyyard
in
conjunction
with
this
dock
on
the
pacific
such
a
station
is
highly
necessary
to
the
convenience
and
effectiveness
of
our
fleet
in
that
ocean
which
must
be
expected
to
increase
with
the
growth
of
commerce
and
the
rapid
extension
of
our
whale
fisheries
over
its
waters
the
naval
academy
at
annapolis
under
a
revised
and
improved
system
of
regulations
now
affords
opportunities
of
education
and
instruction
to
the
pupils
quite
equal
it
is
believed
for
professional
improvement
to
those
enjoyed
by
the
cadets
in
the
military
academy
a
large
class
of
acting
midshipmen
was
received
at
the
commencement
of
the
last
academic
term
and
a
practice
ship
has
been
attached
to
the
institution
to
afford
the
amplest
means
for
regular
instruction
in
seamanship
as
well
as
for
cruises
during
the
vacations
of
three
or
four
months
in
each
year
the
advantages
of
science
in
nautical
affairs
have
rarely
been
more
strikingly
illustrated
than
in
the
fact
stated
in
the
report
of
the
navy
department
that
by
means
of
the
wind
and
current
charts
projected
and
prepared
by
lieutenant
maury
the
superintendent
of
the
naval
observatory
the
passage
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
ports
of
our
country
has
been
shortened
by
about
forty
days
the
estimates
for
the
support
of
the
navy
and
marine
corps
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
will
be
found
to
be
the
estimates
for
the
current
year
being
the
estimates
for
special
objects
under
the
control
of
this
department
amount
to
against
for
the
present
year
the
increase
being
occasioned
by
the
additional
mail
service
on
the
pacific
coast
and
the
construction
of
the
dock
in
california
authorized
at
the
last
session
of
congress
and
some
slight
additions
under
the
head
of
improvements
and
repairs
in
navyyards
buildings
and
machinery
i
deem
it
of
much
importance
to
a
just
economy
and
a
correct
understanding
of
naval
expenditures
that
there
should
be
an
entire
separation
of
the
appropriations
for
the
support
of
the
naval
service
proper
from
those
for
permanent
improvements
at
navyyards
and
stations
and
from
ocean
steam
mail
service
and
other
special
objects
assigned
to
the
supervision
of
this
department
the
report
of
the

presents
an
interesting
view
of
the
progress

and
condition
of
his

close
of
the
last
fiscal

which
is

and

the
tabular
statements
of

the
preceding
year
miles
at
an
increased
cost

the
whole
number
of
postoffices
in

on
the
th
day
of

last
was
there
were
postoffices
established
and
discontinued
during
the
year
the
gross
revenues
of
the
department
for
the
fiscal
year
including
the
appropriations
for
the
franked
matter
of
congress
of
the
departments
and
officers
of
government
and
excluding
the
foreign
postages
collected
for
and
payable
to
the
british
postoffice
amounted
to
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
excluding
paid
under
an
award
of
the
auditor
in
pursuance
of
a
resolution
of
the
last
congress
for
mail
service
on
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers
in
and
and
the
amount
paid
to
the
british
postoffice
for
foreign
postages
collected
for
and
payable
to
that
office
amounted
to
leaving
a
balance
of
revenue
over
the
proper
expenditures
of
the
year
of
the
receipts
for
postages
during
the
year
excluding
the
foreign
postages
collected
for
and
payable
to
the
british
postoffice
amounted
to
being
an
increase
of
or
per
cent
over
the
like
receipts
for
the
preceding
year
the
reduction
of
postage
under
the
act
of
march
last
did
not
take
effect
until
the
commencement
of
the
present
fiscal
year
the
accounts
for
the
first
quarter
under
the
operation
of
the
reduced
rates
will
not
be
settled
before
january
next
and
no
reliable
estimate
of
the
receipts
for
the
present
year
can
yet
be
made
it
is
believed
however
that
they
will
fall
far
short
of
those
of
the
last
year
the
surplus
of
the
revenues
now
on
hand
is
however
so
large
that
no
further
appropriation
from
the
treasury
in
aid
of
the
revenues
of
the
department
is
required
for
the
current
fiscal
year
but
an
additional
appropriation
for
the
year
ending
june
will
probably
be
found
necessary
when
the
receipts
of
the
first
two
quarters
of
the
fiscal
year
are
fully
ascertained
in
his
last
annual
report
the
postmastergeneral
recommended
a
reduction
of
postage
to
rates
which
he
deemed
as
low
as
could
be
prudently
adopted
unless
congress
was
prepared
to
appropriate
from
the
treasury
for
the
support
of
the
department
a
sum
more
than
equivalent
to
the
mail
services
performed
by
it
for
the
government
the
recommendations
of
the
postmastergeneral
in
respect
to
letter
postage
except
on
letters
from
and
to
california
and
oregon
were
substantially
adopted
by
the
last
congress
he
now
recommends
adherence
to
the
present
letter
rates
and
advises
against
a
further
reduction
until
justified
by
the
revenue
of
the
department
he
also
recommends
that
the
rates
of
postage
on
printed
matter
be
so
revised
as
to
render
them
more
simple
and
more
uniform
in
their
operation
upon
all
classes
of
printed
matter
i
submit
the
recommendations
of
the
report
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
public
statutes
of
the
united
states
have
now
been
accumulating
for
more
than
sixty
years
and
interspersed
with
private
acts
are
scattered
through
numerous
volumes
and
from
the
cost
of
the
whole
have
become
almost
inaccessible
to
the
great
mass
of
the
community
they
also
exhibit
much
of
the
incongruity
and
imperfection
of
hasty
legislation
as
it
seems
to
be
generally
conceded
that
there
is
no
common
law
of
the
united
states
to
supply
the
defects
of
their
legislation
it
is
most
important
that
that
legislation
should
be
as
perfect
as
possible
defining
every
power
intended
to
be
conferred
every
crime
intended
to
be
made
punishable
and
prescribing
the
punishment
to
be
inflicted
in
addition
to
some
particular
cases
spoken
of
more
at
length
the
whole
criminal
code
is
now
lamentably
defective
some
offenses
are
imperfectly
described
and
others
are
entirely
omitted
so
that
flagrant
crimes
may
be
committed
with
impunity
the
scale
of
punishment
is
not
in
all
cases
graduated
according
to
the
degree
and
nature
of
the
offense
and
is
often
rendered
more
unequal
by
the
different
modes
of
imprisonment
or
penitentiary
confinement
in
the
different
states
many
laws
of
a
permanent
character
have
been
introduced
into
appropriation
bills
and
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
whether
the
particular
clause
expires
with
the
temporary
act
of
which
it
is
a
part
or
continues
in
force
it
has
also
frequently
happened
that
enactments
and
provisions
of
law
have
been
introduced
into
bills
with
the
title
or
general
subject
of
which
they
have
little
or
no
connection
or
relation
in
this
mode
of
legislation
so
many
enactments
have
been
heaped
upon
each
other
and
often
with
but
little
consideration
that
in
many
instances
it
is
difficult
to
search
out
and
determine
what
is
the
law
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
emphatically
a
government
of
written
laws
the
statutes
should
therefore
as
far
as
practicable
not
only
be
made
accessible
to
all
but
be
expressed
in
language
so
plain
and
simple
as
to
be
understood
by
all
and
arranged
in
such
method
as
to
give
perspicuity
to
every
subject
many
of
the
states
have
revised
their
public
acts
with
great
and
manifest
benefit
and
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
by
law
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
revise
the
public
statutes
of
the
united
states
arranging
them
in
order
supplying
deficiencies
correcting
incongruities
simplifying
their
language
and
reporting
them
to
congress
for
its
action
an
act
of
congress
approved
th
september
contained
a
provision
for
the
extension
of
the
capitol
according
to
such
plan
as
might
be
approved
by
the
president
and
appropriated
to
be
expended
under
his
direction
by
such
architect
as
he
should
appoint
to
execute
the
same
on
examining
the
various
plans
which
had
been
submitted
by
different
architects
in
pursuance
of
an
advertisement
by
a
committee
of
the
senate
no
one
was
found
to
be
entirely
satisfactory
and
it
was
therefore
deemed
advisable
to
combine
and
adopt
the
advantages
of
several
the
great
object
to
be
accomplished
was
to
make
such
an
addition
as
would
afford
ample
and
convenient
halls
for
the
deliberations
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
with
sufficient
accommodations
for
spectators
and
suitable
apartments
for
the
committees
and
officers
of
the
two
branches
of
the
legislature
it
was
also
desirable
not
to
mar
the
harmony
and
beauty
of
the
present
structure
which
as
a
specimen
of
architecture
is
so
universally
admired
keeping
these
objects
in
view
i
concluded
to
make
the
addition
by
wings
detached
from
the
present
building
yet
connected
with
it
by
corridors
this
mode
of
enlargement
will
leave
the
present
capitol
uninjured
and
afford
great
advantages
for
ventilation
and
the
admission
of
light
and
will
enable
the
work
to
progress
without
interrupting
the
deliberations
of
congress
to
carry
this
plan
into
effect
i
have
appointed
an
experienced
and
competent
architect
the
corner
stone
was
laid
on
the
th
day
of
july
last
with
suitable
ceremonies
since
which
time
the
work
has
advanced
with
commendable
rapidity
and
the
foundations
of
both
wings
are
now
nearly
complete
i
again
commend
to
your
favorable
regard
the
interests
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
deem
it
only
necessary
to
remind
you
that
although
its
inhabitants
have
no
voice
in
the
choice
of
representatives
in
congress
they
are
not
the
less
entitled
to
a
just
and
liberal
consideration
in
your
legislation
my
opinions
on
this
subject
were
more
fully
expressed
in
my
last
annual
communication
other
subjects
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
to
which
i
would
respectfully
refer
but
there
was
one
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
to
which
i
again
invite
your
special
attention
i
allude
to
the
recommendation
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
settle
private
claims
against
the
united
states
justice
to
individuals
as
well
as
to
the
government
imperatively
demands
that
some
more
convenient
and
expeditious
mode
than
an
appeal
to
congress
should
be
adopted
it
is
deeply
to
be
regretted
that
in
several
instances
officers
of
the
government
in
attempting
to
execute
the
law
for
the
return
of
fugitives
from
labor
have
been
openly
resisted
and
their
efforts
frustrated
and
defeated
by
lawless
and
violent
mobs
that
in
one
case
such
resistance
resulted
in
the
death
of
an
estimable
citizen
and
in
others
serious
injury
ensued
to
those
officers
and
to
individuals
who
were
using
their
endeavors
to
sustain
the
laws
prosecutions
have
been
instituted
against
the
alleged
offenders
so
far
as
they
could
be
identified
and
are
still
pending
i
have
regarded
it
as
my
duty
in
these
cases
to
give
all
aid
legally
in
my
power
to
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
and
i
shall
continue
to
do
so
wherever
and
whenever
their
execution
may
be
resisted
the
act
of
congress
for
the
return
of
fugitives
from
labor
is
one
required
and
demanded
by
the
express
words
of
the
constitution
the
constitution
declares
thatno
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in
one
state
under
the
laws
thereof
escaping
into
another
shall
in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
therein
be
discharged
from
such
service
or
labor
but
shall
be
delivered
up
on
claim
of
the
party
to
whom
such
service
or
labor
may
be
due
this
constitutional
provision
is
equally
obligatory
upon
the
legislative
the
executive
and
judicial
departments
of
the
government
and
upon
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
congress
however
must
from
necessity
first
act
upon
the
subject
by
prescribing
the
proceedings
necessary
to
ascertain
that
the
person
is
a
fugitive
and
the
means
to
be
used
for
his
restoration
to
the
claimant
this
was
done
by
an
act
passed
during
the
first
term
of
president
washington
which
was
amended
by
that
enacted
by
the
last
congress
and
it
now
remains
for
the
executive
and
judicial
departments
to
take
care
that
these
laws
be
faithfully
executed
this
injunction
of
the
constitution
is
as
peremptory
and
as
binding
as
any
other
it
stands
exactly
on
the
same
foundation
as
that
clause
which
provides
for
the
return
of
fugitives
from
justice
or
that
which
declares
that
no
bill
of
attainder
or
ex
post
facto
law
shall
be
passed
or
that
which
provides
for
an
equality
of
taxation
according
to
the
census
or
the
clause
declaring
that
all
duties
shall
be
uniform
throughout
the
united
states
or
the
important
provision
that
the
trial
of
all
crimes
shall
be
by
jury
these
several
articles
and
clauses
of
the
constitution
all
resting
on
the
same
authority
must
stand
or
fall
together
some
objections
have
been
urged
against
the
details
of
the
act
for
the
return
of
fugitives
from
labor
but
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
the
main
opposition
is
aimed
against
the
constitution
itself
and
proceeds
from
persons
and
classes
of
persons
many
of
whom
declare
their
wish
to
see
that
constitution
overturned
they
avow
their
hostility
to
any
law
which
shall
give
full
and
practical
effect
to
this
requirement
of
the
constitution
fortunately
the
number
of
these
persons
is
comparatively
small
and
is
believed
to
be
daily
diminishing
but
the
issue
which
they
present
is
one
which
involves
the
supremacy
and
even
the
existence
of
the
constitution
cases
have
heretofore
arisen
in
which
individuals
have
denied
the
binding
authority
of
acts
of
congress
and
even
states
have
proposed
to
nullify
such
acts
upon
the
ground
that
the
constitution
was
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
that
those
acts
of
congress
were
repugnant
to
that
instrument
but
nullification
is
now
aimed
not
so
much
against
particular
laws
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
as
against
the
constitution
itself
and
it
is
not
to
be
disguised
that
a
spirit
exists
and
has
been
actively
at
work
to
rend
asunder
this
union
which
is
our
cherished
inheritance
from
our
revolutionary
fathers
in
my
last
annual
message
i
stated
that
i
considered
the
series
of
measures
which
had
been
adopted
at
the
previous
session
in
reference
to
the
agitation
growing
out
of
the
territorial
and
slavery
questions
as
a
final
settlement
in
principle
and
substance
of
the
dangerous
and
exciting
subjects
which
they
embraced
and
i
recommended
adherence
to
the
adjustment
established
by
those
measures
until
time
and
experience
should
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
further
legislation
to
guard
against
evasion
or
abuse
i
was
not
induced
to
make
this
recommendation
because
i
thought
those
measures
perfect
for
no
human
legislation
can
be
perfect
wide
differences
and
jarring
opinions
can
only
be
reconciled
by
yielding
something
on
all
sides
and
this
result
had
been
reached
after
an
angry
conflict
of
many
months
in
which
one
part
of
the
country
was
arrayed
against
another
and
violent
convulsion
seemed
to
be
imminent
looking
at
the
interests
of
the
whole
country
i
felt
it
to
be
my
duty
to
seize
upon
this
compromise
as
the
best
that
could
be
obtained
amid
conflicting
interests
and
to
insist
upon
it
as
a
final
settlement
to
be
adhered
to
by
all
who
value
the
peace
and
welfare
of
the
country
a
year
has
now
elapsed
since
that
recommendation
was
made
to
that
recommendation
i
still
adhere
and
i
congratulate
you
and
the
country
upon
the
general
acquiescence
in
these
measures
of
peace
which
has
been
exhibited
in
all
parts
of
the
republic
and
not
only
is
there
this
general
acquiescence
in
these
measures
but
the
spirit
of
conciliation
which
has
been
manifested
in
regard
to
them
in
all
parts
of
the
country
has
removed
doubts
and
uncertainties
in
the
minds
of
thousands
of
good
men
concerning
the
durability
of
our
popular
institutions
and
given
renewed
assurance
that
our
liberty
and
our
union
may
subsist
together
for
the
benefit
of
this
and
all
succeeding
generations
