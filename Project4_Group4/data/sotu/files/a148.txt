mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
in
our
national
history
a
president
delivers
his
annual
message
to
a
new
congress
within
a
fortnight
of
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
while
there
is
no
change
in
the
presidency
this
year
change
will
occur
in
future
years
it
is
my
belief
that
under
this
new
constitutional
practice
the
president
should
in
every
fourth
year
in
so
far
as
seems
reasonable
review
the
existing
state
of
our
national
affairs
and
outline
broad
future
problems
leaving
specific
recommendations
for
future
legislation
to
be
made
by
the
president
about
to
be
inaugurated
at
this
time
however
circumstances
of
the
moment
compel
me
to
ask
your
immediate
consideration
of
first
measures
extending
the
life
of
certain
authorizations
and
powers
which
under
present
statutes
expire
within
a
few
weeks
second
an
addition
to
the
existing
neutrality
act
to
cover
specific
points
raised
by
the
unfortunate
civil
strife
in
spain
and
third
a
deficiency
appropriation
bill
for
which
i
shall
submit
estimates
this
week
in
march
the
problems
which
faced
our
nation
and
which
only
our
national
government
had
the
resources
to
meet
were
more
serious
even
than
appeared
on
the
surface
it
was
not
only
that
the
visible
mechanism
of
economic
life
had
broken
down
more
disturbing
was
the
fact
that
long
neglect
of
the
needs
of
the
underprivileged
had
brought
too
many
of
our
people
to
the
verge
of
doubt
as
to
the
successful
adaptation
of
our
historic
traditions
to
the
complex
modern
world
in
that
lay
a
challenge
to
our
democratic
form
of
government
itself
ours
was
the
task
to
prove
that
democracy
could
be
made
to
function
in
the
world
of
today
as
effectively
as
in
the
simpler
world
of
a
hundred
years
ago
ours
was
the
task
to
do
more
than
to
argue
a
theory
the
times
required
the
confident
answer
of
performance
to
those
whose
instinctive
faith
in
humanity
made
them
want
to
believe
that
in
the
long
run
democracy
would
prove
superior
to
more
extreme
forms
of
government
as
a
process
of
getting
action
when
action
was
wisdom
without
the
spiritual
sacrifices
which
those
other
forms
of
government
exact
that
challenge
we
met
to
meet
it
required
unprecedented
activities
under
federal
leadership
to
end
abuses
to
restore
a
large
measure
of
material
prosperity
to
give
new
faith
to
millions
of
our
citizens
who
had
been
traditionally
taught
to
expect
that
democracy
would
provide
continuously
wider
opportunity
and
continuously
greater
security
in
a
world
where
science
was
continuously
making
material
riches
more
available
to
man
in
the
many
methods
of
attack
with
which
we
met
these
problems
you
and
i
by
mutual
understanding
and
by
determination
to
cooperate
helped
to
make
democracy
succeed
by
refusing
to
permit
unnecessary
disagreement
to
arise
between
two
of
our
branches
of
government
that
spirit
of
cooperation
was
able
to
solve
difficulties
of
extraordinary
magnitude
and
ramification
with
few
important
errors
and
at
a
cost
cheap
when
measured
by
the
immediate
necessities
and
the
eventual
results
i
look
forward
to
a
continuance
of
that
cooperation
in
the
next
four
years
i
look
forward
also
to
a
continuance
of
the
basis
of
that
cooperation
mutual
respect
for
each
others
proper
sphere
of
functioning
in
a
democracy
which
is
working
well
and
a
commonsense
realization
of
the
need
for
play
in
the
joints
of
the
machine
on
that
basis
it
is
within
the
right
of
the
congress
to
determine
which
of
the
many
new
activities
shall
be
continued
or
abandoned
increased
or
curtailed
on
that
same
basis
the
president
alone
has
the
responsibility
for
their
administration
i
find
that
this
task
of
executive
management
has
reached
the
point
where
our
administrative
machinery
needs
comprehensive
overhauling
i
shall
therefore
shortly
address
the
congress
more
fully
in
regard
to
modernizing
and
improving
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
that
cooperation
of
the
past
four
years
between
the
congress
and
the
president
has
aimed
at
the
fulfillment
of
a
twofold
policy
first
economic
recovery
through
many
kinds
of
assistance
to
agriculture
industry
and
banking
and
second
deliberate
improvement
in
the
personal
security
and
opportunity
of
the
great
mass
of
our
people
the
recovery
we
sought
was
not
to
be
merely
temporary
it
was
to
be
a
recovery
protected
from
the
causes
of
previous
disasters
with
that
aim
in
viewto
prevent
a
future
similar
crisisyou
and
i
joined
in
a
series
of
enactmentssafe
banking
and
sound
currency
the
guarantee
of
bank
deposits
protection
for
the
investor
in
securities
the
removal
of
the
threat
of
agricultural
surpluses
insistence
on
collective
bargaining
the
outlawing
of
sweat
shops
child
labor
and
unfair
trade
practices
and
the
beginnings
of
security
for
the
aged
and
the
worker
nor
was
the
recovery
we
sought
merely
a
purposeless
whirring
of
machinery
it
is
important
of
course
that
every
man
and
woman
in
the
country
be
able
to
find
work
that
every
factory
run
that
business
and
farming
as
a
whole
earn
profits
but
government
in
a
democratic
nation
does
not
exist
solely
or
even
primarily
for
that
purpose
it
is
not
enough
that
the
wheels
turn
they
must
carry
us
in
the
direction
of
a
greater
satisfaction
in
life
for
the
average
man
the
deeper
purpose
of
democratic
government
is
to
assist
as
many
of
its
citizens
as
possible
especially
those
who
need
it
most
to
improve
their
conditions
of
life
to
retain
all
personal
liberty
which
does
not
adversely
affect
their
neighbors
and
to
pursue
the
happiness
which
comes
with
security
and
an
opportunity
for
recreation
and
culture
even
with
our
present
recovery
we
are
far
from
the
goal
of
that
deeper
purpose
there
are
farreaching
problems
still
with
us
for
which
democracy
must
find
solutions
if
it
is
to
consider
itself
successful
for
example
many
millions
of
americans
still
live
in
habitations
which
not
only
fail
to
provide
the
physical
benefits
of
modern
civilization
but
breed
disease
and
impair
the
health
of
future
generations
the
menace
exists
not
only
in
the
slum
areas
of
the
very
large
cities
but
in
many
smaller
cities
as
well
it
exists
on
tens
of
thousands
of
farms
in
varying
degrees
in
every
part
of
the
country
another
example
is
the
prevalence
of
an
unamerican
type
of
tenant
farming
i
do
not
suggest
that
every
farm
family
has
the
capacity
to
earn
a
satisfactory
living
on
its
own
farm
but
many
thousands
of
tenant
farmers
indeed
most
of
them
with
some
financial
assistance
and
with
some
advice
and
training
can
be
made
selfsupporting
on
land
which
can
eventually
belong
to
them
the
nation
would
be
wise
to
offer
them
that
chance
instead
of
permitting
them
to
go
along
as
they
do
now
year
after
year
with
neither
future
security
as
tenants
nor
hope
of
ownership
of
their
homes
nor
expectation
of
bettering
the
lot
of
their
children
another
national
problem
is
the
intelligent
development
of
our
social
security
system
the
broadening
of
the
services
it
renders
and
practical
improvement
in
its
operation
in
many
nations
where
such
laws
are
in
effect
success
in
meeting
the
expectations
of
the
community
has
come
through
frequent
amendment
of
the
original
statute
and
of
course
the
most
farreaching
and
the
most
inclusive
problem
of
all
is
that
of
unemployment
and
the
lack
of
economic
balance
of
which
unemployment
is
at
once
the
result
and
the
symptom
the
immediate
question
of
adequate
relief
for
the
needy
unemployed
who
are
capable
of
performing
useful
work
i
shall
discuss
with
the
congress
during
the
coming
months
the
broader
task
of
preventing
unemployment
is
a
matter
of
longrange
evolutionary
policy
to
that
we
must
continue
to
give
our
best
thought
and
effort
we
cannot
assume
that
immediate
industrial
and
commercial
activity
which
mitigates
present
pressures
justifies
the
national
government
at
this
time
in
placing
the
unemployment
problem
in
a
filing
cabinet
of
finished
business
fluctuations
in
employment
are
tied
to
all
other
wasteful
fluctuations
in
our
mechanism
of
production
and
distribution
one
of
these
wastes
is
speculation
in
securities
or
commodities
the
larger
the
volume
of
speculation
the
wider
become
the
upward
and
downward
swings
and
the
more
certain
the
result
that
in
the
long
run
there
will
be
more
losses
than
gains
in
the
underlying
wealth
of
the
community
and
as
is
now
well
known
to
all
of
us
the
same
net
loss
to
society
comes
from
reckless
overproduction
and
monopolistic
underproduction
of
natural
and
manufactured
commodities
overproduction
underproduction
and
speculation
are
three
evil
sisters
who
distill
the
troubles
of
unsound
inflation
and
disastrous
deflation
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
nation
to
have
government
help
private
enterprise
to
gain
sound
general
price
levels
and
to
protect
those
levels
from
wide
perilous
fluctuations
we
know
now
that
if
early
in
government
had
taken
the
steps
which
were
taken
two
and
three
years
later
the
depression
would
never
have
reached
the
depths
of
the
beginning
of
sober
second
thought
confirms
most
of
us
in
the
belief
that
the
broad
objectives
of
the
national
recovery
act
were
sound
we
know
now
that
its
difficulties
arose
from
the
fact
that
it
tried
to
do
too
much
for
example
it
was
unwise
to
expect
the
same
agency
to
regulate
the
length
of
working
hours
minimum
wages
child
labor
and
collective
bargaining
on
the
one
hand
and
the
complicated
questions
of
unfair
trade
practices
and
business
controls
on
the
other
the
statute
of
nra
has
been
outlawed
the
problems
have
not
they
are
still
with
us
that
decent
conditions
and
adequate
pay
for
labor
and
just
return
for
agriculture
can
be
secured
through
parallel
and
simultaneous
action
by
fortyeight
states
is
a
proven
impossibility
it
is
equally
impossible
to
obtain
curbs
on
monopoly
unfair
trade
practices
and
speculation
by
state
action
alone
there
are
those
who
sincerely
or
insincerely
still
cling
to
state
action
as
a
theoretical
hope
but
experience
with
actualities
makes
it
clear
that
federal
laws
supplementing
state
laws
are
needed
to
help
solve
the
problems
which
result
from
modern
invention
applied
in
an
industrialized
nation
which
conducts
its
business
with
scant
regard
to
state
lines
during
the
past
year
there
has
been
a
growing
belief
that
there
is
little
fault
to
be
found
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
it
stands
today
the
vital
need
is
not
an
alteration
of
our
fundamental
law
but
an
increasingly
enlightened
view
with
reference
to
it
difficulties
have
grown
out
of
its
interpretation
but
rightly
considered
it
can
be
used
as
an
instrument
of
progress
and
not
as
a
device
for
prevention
of
action
it
is
worth
our
while
to
read
and
reread
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
and
article
i
thereof
which
confers
the
legislative
powers
upon
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
is
also
worth
our
while
to
read
again
the
debates
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
from
such
reading
i
obtain
the
very
definite
thought
that
the
members
of
that
convention
were
fully
aware
that
civilization
would
raise
problems
for
the
proposed
new
federal
government
which
they
themselves
could
not
even
surmise
and
that
it
was
their
definite
intent
and
expectation
that
a
liberal
interpretation
in
the
years
to
come
would
give
to
the
congress
the
same
relative
powers
over
new
national
problems
as
they
themselves
gave
to
the
congress
over
the
national
problems
of
their
day
in
presenting
to
the
convention
the
first
basic
draft
of
the
constitution
edmund
randolph
explained
that
it
was
the
purpose
to
insert
essential
principles
only
lest
the
operation
of
government
should
be
clogged
by
rendering
those
provisions
permanent
and
unalterable
which
ought
to
be
accommodated
to
times
and
events
with
a
better
understanding
of
our
purposes
and
a
more
intelligent
recognition
of
our
needs
as
a
nation
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
there
will
be
prolonged
failure
to
bring
legislative
and
judicial
action
into
closer
harmony
means
must
be
found
to
adapt
our
legal
forms
and
our
judicial
interpretation
to
the
actual
present
national
needs
of
the
largest
progressive
democracy
in
the
modern
world
that
thought
leads
to
a
consideration
of
world
problems
to
go
no
further
back
than
the
beginning
of
this
century
men
and
women
everywhere
were
seeking
conditions
of
life
very
different
from
those
which
were
customary
before
modern
invention
and
modern
industry
and
modern
communications
had
come
into
being
the
world
war
for
all
of
its
tragedy
encouraged
these
demands
and
stimulated
action
to
fulfill
these
new
desires
many
national
governments
seemed
unable
adequately
to
respond
and
often
with
the
improvident
assent
of
the
masses
of
the
people
themselves
new
forms
of
government
were
set
up
with
oligarchy
taking
the
place
of
democracy
in
oligarchies
militarism
has
leapt
forward
while
in
those
nations
which
have
retained
democracy
militarism
has
waned
i
have
recently
visited
three
of
our
sister
republics
in
south
america
the
very
cordial
receptions
with
which
i
was
greeted
were
in
tribute
to
democracy
to
me
the
outstanding
observation
of
that
visit
was
that
the
masses
of
the
peoples
of
all
the
americas
are
convinced
that
the
democratic
form
of
government
can
be
made
to
succeed
and
do
not
wish
to
substitute
for
it
any
other
form
of
government
they
believe
that
democracies
are
best
able
to
cope
with
the
changing
problems
of
modern
civilization
within
themselves
and
that
democracies
are
best
able
to
maintain
peace
among
themselves
the
interamerican
conference
operating
on
these
fundamental
principles
of
democracy
did
much
to
assure
peace
in
this
hemisphere
existing
peace
machinery
was
improved
new
instruments
to
maintain
peace
and
eliminate
causes
of
war
were
adopted
wider
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
american
republics
in
the
event
of
war
outside
the
western
hemisphere
was
provided
respect
for
and
observance
of
international
treaties
and
international
law
were
strengthened
principles
of
liberal
trade
policies
as
effective
aids
to
the
maintenance
of
peace
were
reaffirmed
the
intellectual
and
cultural
relationships
among
american
republics
were
broadened
as
a
part
of
the
general
peace
program
in
a
world
unhappily
thinking
in
terms
of
war
the
representatives
of
twentyone
nations
sat
around
a
table
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
confidence
and
understanding
sincerely
discussing
measures
for
maintaining
peace
here
was
a
great
and
a
permanent
achievement
directly
affecting
the
lives
and
security
of
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
human
beings
who
dwell
in
this
western
hemisphere
here
was
an
example
which
must
have
a
wholesome
effect
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
in
a
very
real
sense
the
conference
in
buenos
aires
sent
forth
a
message
on
behalf
of
all
the
democracies
of
the
world
to
those
nations
which
live
otherwise
because
such
other
governments
are
perhaps
more
spectacular
it
was
high
time
for
democracy
to
assert
itself
because
all
of
us
believe
that
our
democratic
form
of
government
can
cope
adequately
with
modern
problems
as
they
arise
it
is
patriotic
as
well
as
logical
for
us
to
prove
that
we
can
meet
new
national
needs
with
new
laws
consistent
with
an
historic
constitutional
framework
clearly
intended
to
receive
liberal
and
not
narrow
interpretation
the
united
states
of
america
within
itself
must
continue
the
task
of
making
democracy
succeed
in
that
task
the
legislative
branch
of
our
government
will
i
am
confident
continue
to
meet
the
demands
of
democracy
whether
they
relate
to
the
curbing
of
abuses
the
extension
of
help
to
those
who
need
help
or
the
better
balancing
of
our
interdependent
economies
so
too
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
must
move
forward
in
this
task
and
at
the
same
time
provide
better
management
for
administrative
action
of
all
kinds
the
judicial
branch
also
is
asked
by
the
people
to
do
its
part
in
making
democracy
successful
we
do
not
ask
the
courts
to
call
nonexistent
powers
into
being
but
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
conceded
powers
or
those
legitimately
implied
shall
be
made
effective
instruments
for
the
common
good
the
process
of
our
democracy
must
not
be
imperiled
by
the
denial
of
essential
powers
of
free
government
your
task
and
mine
is
not
ending
with
the
end
of
the
depression
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
made
it
clear
that
they
expect
us
to
continue
our
active
efforts
in
behalf
of
their
peaceful
advancement
in
that
spirit
of
