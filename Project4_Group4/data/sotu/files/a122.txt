arbitration
the
year
has
been
notable
as
witnessing
the
pacific
settlement
of
two
important
international
controversies
before
the
permanent
court
of
the
hague
the
arbitration
of
the
fisheries
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
which
has
been
the
source
of
nearly
continuous
diplomatic
correspondence
since
the
fisheries
convention
of
has
given
an
award
which
is
satisfactory
to
both
parties
this
arbitration
is
particularly
noteworthy
not
only
because
of
the
eminently
just
results
secured
but
also
because
it
is
the
first
arbitration
held
under
the
general
arbitration
treaty
of
april
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
and
disposes
of
a
controversy
the
settlement
of
which
has
resisted
every
other
resource
of
diplomacy
and
which
for
nearly
ninety
years
has
been
the
cause
of
friction
between
two
countries
whose
common
interest
lies
in
maintaining
the
most
friendly
and
cordial
relations
with
each
other
the
united
states
was
ably
represented
before
the
tribunal
the
complicated
history
of
the
questions
arising
made
the
issue
depend
more
than
ordinarily
in
such
cases
upon
the
care
and
skill
with
which
our
case
was
presented
and
i
should
be
wanting
in
proper
recognition
of
a
great
patriotic
service
if
i
did
not
refer
to
the
lucid
historical
analysis
of
the
facts
and
the
signal
ability
and
force
of
the
argumentsix
days
in
lengthpresented
to
the
court
in
support
of
our
case
by
mr
elihu
root
as
secretary
of
state
mr
root
had
given
close
study
to
the
intricate
facts
bearing
on
the
controversy
and
by
diplomatic
correspondence
had
helped
to
frame
the
issues
at
the
solicitation
of
the
secretary
of
state
and
myself
mr
root
though
burdened
by
his
duties
as
senator
from
new
york
undertook
the
preparation
of
the
case
as
leading
counsel
with
the
condition
imposed
by
himself
that
in
view
of
his
position
as
senator
he
should
not
receive
any
compensation
the
tribunal
constituted
at
the
hague
by
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
venezuela
has
completed
its
deliberations
and
has
rendered
an
award
in
the
case
of
the
orinoco
steamship
company
against
venezuela
the
award
may
be
regarded
as
satisfactory
since
it
has
pursuant
to
the
contentions
of
the
united
states
recognized
a
number
of
important
principles
making
for
a
judicial
attitude
in
the
determining
of
international
disputes
in
view
of
grave
doubts
which
had
been
raised
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
hague
convention
for
the
establishment
of
an
international
prize
court
now
before
the
senate
for
ratification
because
of
that
provision
of
the
convention
which
provides
that
there
may
be
an
appeal
to
the
proposed
court
from
the
decisions
of
national
courts
this
government
proposed
in
an
identic
circular
note
addressed
to
those
powers
who
had
taken
part
in
the
london
maritime
conference
that
the
powers
signatory
to
the
convention
if
confronted
with
such
difficulty
might
insert
a
reservation
to
the
effect
that
appeals
to
the
international
prize
court
in
respect
to
decisions
of
its
national
tribunals
should
take
the
form
of
a
direct
claim
for
compensation
that
the
proceedings
thereupon
to
be
taken
should
be
in
the
form
of
a
trial
de
novo
and
that
judgment
of
the
court
should
consist
of
compensation
for
the
illegal
capture
irrespective
of
the
decision
of
the
national
court
whose
judgment
had
thus
been
internationally
involved
as
the
result
of
an
informal
discussion
it
was
decided
to
provide
such
procedure
by
means
of
a
separate
protocol
which
should
be
ratified
at
the
same
time
as
the
prize
court
convention
itself
accordingly
the
government
of
the
netherlands
at
the
request
of
this
government
proposed
under
date
of
may
to
the
powers
signatory
to
the
hague
convention
the
negotiation
of
a
supplemental
protocol
embodying
stipulations
providing
for
this
alternative
procedure
it
is
gratifying
to
observe
that
this
additional
protocol
is
being
signed
without
objection
by
the
powers
signatory
to
the
original
convention
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
international
prize
court
will
be
soon
established
the
identic
circular
note
also
proposed
that
the
international
prize
court
when
established
should
be
endowed
with
the
functions
of
an
arbitral
court
of
justice
under
and
pursuant
to
the
recommendation
adopted
by
the
last
hague
conference
the
replies
received
from
the
various
powers
to
this
proposal
inspire
the
hope
that
this
also
may
be
accomplished
within
the
reasonably
near
future
it
is
believed
that
the
establishment
of
these
two
tribunals
will
go
a
long
way
toward
securing
the
arbitration
of
many
questions
which
have
heretofore
threatened
and
at
times
destroyed
the
peace

for

lines
from

southward
to

results
approved

the
basis
of
the

in

the
application
of
the
principle
underlying
the
policy
of
the

in
regard
to
the

viz
that
of
the
internationalization
of
the
foreign
interest
in
such
of
the
railways
of
china
as
may
be
financed
by
foreign
countries
was
suggested
on
a
broader
scale
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
a
proposal
for
internationalization
and
commercial
neutralization
of
all
the
railways
of
manchuria
while
the
principle
which
led
to
the
proposal
of
this
government
was
generally
admitted
by
the
powers
to
whom
it
was
addressed
the
governments
of
russia
and
japan
apprehended
practical
difficulties
in
the
execution
of
the
larger
plan
which
prevented
their
ready
adherence
the
question
of
constructing
the
chinchowaigun
railway
by
means
of
an
international
loan
to
china
is
however
still
the
subject
of
friendly
discussion
by
the
interested
parties
the
policy
of
this
government
in
these
matters
has
been
directed
by
a
desire
to
make
the
use
of
american
capital
in
the
development
of
china
an
instrument
in
the
promotion
of
chinas
welfare
and
material
prosperity
without
prejudice
to
her
legitimate
rights
as
an
independent
political
power
this
policy
has
recently
found
further
exemplification
in
the
assistance
given
by
this
government
to
the
negotiations
between
china
and
a
group
of
american
bankers
for
a
loan
of
to
be
employed
chiefly
in
currency
reform
the
confusion
which
has
from
ancient
times
existed
in
the
monetary
usages
of
the
chinese
has
been
one
of
the
principal
obstacles
to
commercial
intercourse
with
that
people
the
united
states
in
its
treaty
of
with
china
obtained
a
pledge
from
the
latter
to
introduce
a
uniform
national
coinage
and
the
following
year
at
the
request
of
china
this
government
sent
to
peking
a
member
of
the
international
exchange
commission
to
discuss
with
the
chinese
government
the
best
methods
of
introducing
the
reform
in
china
sent
a
commissioner
to
the
united
states
to
consult
with
american
financiers
as
to
the
possibility
of
securing
a
large
loan
with
which
to
inaugurate
the
new
currency
system
but
the
death
of
their
majesties
the
empress
dowager
and
the
emperor
of
china
interrupted
the
negotiations
which
were
not
resumed
until
a
few
months
ago
when
this
government
was
asked
to
communicate
to
the
bankers
concerned
the
request
of

for
a
loan
of

the
purpose

review
a
preliminary
agreement
between
the
american
group
and
china
has
been
made
covering
the
loan
for
the
success
of
this
loan
and
the
contemplated
reforms
which
are
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
commercial
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
civilized
world
at
large
it
is
realized
that
an
expert
will
be
necessary
and
this
government
has
received
assurances
from
china
that
such
an
adviser
who
shall
be
an
american
will
be
engaged
it
is
a
matter
of
interest

which
is
attending
the
efforts
of

when

needed

heretofore
it
has

lacking

arbitration
of
pecuniary
claims
was
signed
and
a
number
of
important
resolutions
passed
the
conventions
will
in
due
course
be
transmitted
to
the
senate
and
the
report
of
the
delegation
of
the
united
states
will
be
communicated
to
the
congress
for
its
information
the
special
cordiality
between
representative
men
from
all
parts
of
america
which
was
shown
at
this
conference
cannot
fail
to
react
upon
and
draw
still
closer
the
relations
between
the
countries
which
took
part
in
it
the
international
bureau
of
american
republics
is
doing
a
broad
and
useful
work
for
pan
american
commerce
and
comity
its
duties
were
much
enlarged
by
the
international
conference
of
american
states
at
buenos
aires
and
its
name
was
shortened
to
the
more
practical
and
expressive
term
of
pan
american
union
located
now
in
its
new
building
which
was
specially
dedicated
april
of
this
year
to
the
development
of
friendship
trade
and
peace
among
the
american
nations
it
has
improved
instrumentalities
to
serve
the
twentytwo
republics
of
this
hemisphere
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
action
of
the
united
states
in
its
desire
to
remove
imminent
danger
of
war
between
peru
and
ecuador
growing
out
of
a
boundary
dispute
with
the
cooperation
of
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
as
joint
mediators
with
this
government
has
already
resulted
successfully
in
preventing
war
the
government
of
chile
while
not
one
of
the
mediators
lent
effective
aid
in
furtherance
of
a
preliminary
agreement
likely
to
lead
on
to
an
amicable
settlement
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
the
good
offices
of
the
mediating
powers
and
the
conciliatory
cooperation
of
the
governments
directly
interested
will
finally
lead
to
a
removal
of
this
perennial
cause
of
friction
between
ecuador
and
peru
the
inestimable
value
of
cordial
cooperation
between
the
sister
republics
of
america
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
in
this
hemisphere
has
never
been
more
clearly
shown
than
in
this
mediation
by
which
three
american
governments
have
given
to
this
hemisphere
the
honor
of
first
invoking
the
most
farreaching
provisions
of
the
hague
convention
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
disputes
there
has
been
signed
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
a
protocol
submitting
to
the
united
statesmexican
boundary
commission
whose
membership
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
is
to
be
increased
by
the
addition
of
a
citizen
of
canada
the
question
of
sovereignty
over
the
chamizal
tract
which
lies
within
the
present
physical
boundaries
of
the
city
of
e
paso
tex
the
determination
of
this
question
will
remove
a
source
of
no
little
annoyance
to
the
two
governments
the
republic
of
honduras
has
for
many
years
been
burdened
with
a
heavy
bonded
debt
held
in
europe
the
interest
on
which
long
ago
fell
in
arrears
finally
conditions
were
such
that
it
became
imperative
to
refund
the
debt
and
place
the
finances
of
the
republic
upon
a
sound
basis
last
year
a
group
of
american
bankers
undertook
to
do
this
and
to
advance
funds
for
railway
and
other
improvements
contributing
directly
to
the
countrys
prosperity
and
commercean
arrangement
which
has
long
been
desired
by
this
government
negotiations
to
this
end
have
been
under
way
for
more
than
a
year
and
it
is
now
confidently
believed
that
a
short
time
will
suffice
to
conclude
an
arrangement
which
will
be
satisfactory
to
the
foreign
creditors
eminently
advantageous
to
honduras
and
highly
creditable
to
the
judgment
and
foresight
of
the
honduranean
government
this
is
much
to
be
desired
since
as
recognized
by
the
washington
conventions
a
strong
honduras
would
tend
immensely
to
the
progress
and
prosperity
of
central
america
during
the
past
year
the
republic
of
nicaragua
has
been
the
scene
of
internecine
struggle
general
zelaya
for
seventeen
years
the
absolute
ruler
of
nicaragua
was
throughout
his
career
the
disturber
of
central
america
and
opposed
every
plan
for
the
promotion
of
peace
and
friendly
relations
between
the
five
republics
when
the
people
of
nicaragua
were
finally
driven
into
rebellion
by
his
lawless
exactions
he
violated
the
laws
of
war
by
the
unwarranted
execution
of
two
american
citizens
who
had
regularly
enlisted
in
the
ranks
of
the
revolutionists
this
and
other
offenses
made
it
the
duty
of
the
american
government
to
take
measures
with
a
view
to
ultimate
reparation
and
for
the
safeguarding
of
its
interests
this
involved
the
breaking
off
of
all
diplomatic
relations
with
the
zelaya
government
for
the
reasons
laid
down
in
a
communication
from
the
secretary
of
state
which
also
notified
the
contending
factions
in
nicaragua
that
this
government
would
hold
each
to
strict
accountability
for
outrages
on
the
rights
of
american
citizens
american
forces
were
sent
to
both
coasts
of
nicaragua
to
be
in
readiness
should
occasion
arise
to
protect
americans
and
their
interests
and
remained
there
until
the
war
was
over
and
peace
had
returned
to
that
unfortunate
country
these
events
together
with
zelayas
continued
exactions
brought
him
so
clearly
to
the
bar
of
public
opinion
that
he
was
forced
to
resign
and
to
take
refuge
abroad
in
the
abovementioned
communication
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
charge
daffaires
of
the
zelaya
government
the
opinion
was
expressed
that
the
revolution
represented
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
the
nicaraguan
people
this
has
now
been
proved
beyond
doubt
by
the
fact
that
since
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
madriz
government
and
the
occupation
of
the
capital
by
the
forces
of
the
revolution
all
factions
have
united
to
maintain
public
order
and
as
a
result
of
discussion
with
an
agent
of
this
government
sent
to
managua
at
the
request
of
the
provisional
government
comprehensive
plans
are
being
made
for
the
future
welfare
of
nicaragua
including
the
rehabilitation
of
public
credit
the
moderation
and
conciliatory
spirit
shown
by
the
various
factions
give
ground
for
the
confident
hope
that
nicaragua
will
soon
take
its
rightful
place
among
the
lawabiding
and
progressive
countries
of
the
world
it
gratifies
me
exceedingly
to
announce
that
the
argentine
republic
some
months
ago
placed
with
american
manufacturers
a
contract
for
the
construction
of
two
battleships
and
certain
additional
naval
equipment
the
extent
of
this
work
and
its
importance
to
the
argentine
republic
make
the
placing
of
the
bid
an
earnest
of
friendly
feeling
toward
the
united
states
tariff
negotiations
the
new
tariff
law
in
section
respecting
the
maximum
and
minimum
tariffs
of
the
united
states
which
provisions
came
into
effect
on
april
imposed
upon
the
president
the
responsibility
of
determining
prior
to
that
date
whether
or
not
any
undue
discrimination
existed
against
the
united
states
and
its
products
in
any
country
of
the
world
with
which
we
sustained
commercial
relations
in
the
case
of
several
countries
instances
of
apparent
undue
discrimination
against
american
commerce
were
found
to
exist
these
discriminations
were
removed
by
negotiation
prior
to
april
when
the
maximum
tariff
was
to
come
into
operation
with
respect
to
importations
from
all
those
countries
in
whose
favor
no
proclamation
applying
the
minimum
tariff
should
be
issued
by
the
president
one
hundred
and
thirtyfour
such
proclamations
were
issued
this
series
of
proclamations
embraced
the
entire
commercial
world
and
hence
the
minimum
tariff
of
the
united
states
has
been
given
universal
application
thus
testifying
to
the
satisfactory
character
of
our
trade
relations
with
foreign
countries
marked
advantages
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
were
obtained
through
these
tariff
settlements
foreign
nations
are
fully
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
under
section
of
the
tariff
act
the
president
is
required
whenever
he
is
satisfied
that
the
treatment
accorded
by
them
to
the
products
of
the
united
states
is
not
such
as
to
entitle
them
to
the
benefits
of
the
minimum
tariff
of
the
united
states
to
withdraw
those
benefits
by
proclamation
giving
ninety
days
notice
after
which
the
maximum
tariff
will
apply
to
their
dutiable
products
entering
the
united
states
in
its
general
operation
this
section
of
the
tariff
law
has
thus
far
proved
a
guaranty
of
continued
commercial
peace
although
there
are
unfortunately
instances
where
foreign
governments
deal
arbitrarily
with
american
interests
within
their
jurisdiction
in
a
manner
injurious
and
inequitable
the
policy
of
broader
and
closer
trade
relations
with
the
dominion
of
canada
which
was
initiated
in
the
adjustment
of
the
maximum
and
minimum
provisions
of
the
tariff
act
of
august
has
proved
mutually
beneficial
it
justifies
further
efforts
for
the
readjustment
of
the
commercial
relations
of
the
two
countries
so
that
their
commerce
may
follow
the
channels
natural
to
contiguous
countries
and
be
commensurate
with
the
steady
expansion
of
trade
and
industry
on
both
sides
of
the
boundary
line
the
reciprocation
on
the
part
of
the
dominion
government
of
the
sentiment
which
was
expressed
by
this
government
was
followed
in
october
by
the
suggestion
that
it
would
be
glad
to
have
the
negotiations
which
had
been
temporarily
suspended
during
the
summer
resumed
in
accordance
with
this
suggestion
the
secretary
of
state
by
my
direction
dispatched
two
representatives
of
the
department
of
state
as
special
commissioners
to
ottawa
to
confer
with
representatives
of
the
dominion
government
they
were
authorized
to
take
such
steps
for
formulating
a
reciprocal
trade
agreement
as
might
be
necessary
and
to
receive
and
consider
any
propositions
which
the
dominion
government
might
care
to
submit
pursuant
to
the
instructions
issued
conferences
were
held
by
these
commissioners
with
officials
of
the
dominion
government
at
ottawa
in
the
early
part
of
november
the
negotiations
were
conducted
on
both
sides
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
accommodation
the
discussion
of
the
common
commercial
interests
of
the
two
countries
had
for
its
object
a
satisfactory
basis
for
a
trade
arrangement
which
offers
the
prospect
of
a
freer
interchange
for
the
products
of
the
united
states
and
of
canada
the
conferences
were
adjourned
to
be
resumed
in
washington
in
january
when
it
is
hoped
that
the
aspiration
of
both
governments
for
a
mutually
advantageous
measure
of
reciprocity
will
be
realized
fostering
foreign
trade
all
these
tariff
negotiations
so
vital
to
our
commerce
and
industry
and
the
duty
of
jealously
guarding
the
equitable
and
just
treatment
of
our
products
capital
and
industry
abroad
devolve
upon
the
department
of
state
the
argentine
battleship
contracts
like
the
subsequent
important
one
for
argentine
railway
equipment
and
those
for
cuban
government
vessels
were
secured
for
our
manufacturers
largely
through
the
good
offices
of
the
department
of
state
the
efforts
of
that
department
to
secure
for
citizens
of
the
united
states
equal
opportunities
in
the
markets
of
the
world
and
to
expand
american
commerce
have
been
most
successful
the
volume
of
business
obtained
in
new
fields
of
competition
and
upon
new
lines
is
already
very
great
and
congress
is
urged
to
continue
to
support
the
department
of
state
in
its
endeavors
for
further
trade
expansion
our
foreign
trade
merits
the
best
support
of
the
government
and
the
most
earnest
endeavor
of
our
manufacturers
and
merchants
who
if
they
do
not
already
in
all
cases
need
a
foreign
market
are
certain
soon
to
become
dependent
on
it
therefore
now
is
the
time
to
secure
a
strong
position
in
this
field
american
branch
banks
abroad
i
cannot
leave
this
subject
without
emphasizing
the
necessity
of
such
legislation
as
will
make
possible
and
convenient
the
establishment
of
american
banks
and
branches
of
american
banks
in
foreign
countries
only
by
such
means
can
our
foreign
trade
be
favorably
financed
necessary
credits
be
arranged
and
proper
avail
be
made
of
commercial
opportunities
in
foreign
countries
and
most
especially
in
latin
america
aid
to
our
foreign
merchant
marine
another
instrumentality
indispensable
to
the
unhampered
and
natural
development
of
american
commerce
is
merchant
marine
all
maritime
and
commercial
nations
recognize
the
importance
of
this
factor
the
greatest
commercial
nations
our
competitors
jealously
foster
their
merchant
marine
perhaps
nowhere
is
the
need
for
rapid
and
direct
mail
passenger
and
freight
communication
quite
so
urgent
as
between
the
united
states
and
latin
america
we
can
secure
in
no
other
quarter
of
the
world
such
immediate
benefits
in
friendship
and
commerce
as
would
flow
from
the
establishment
of
direct
lines
of
communication
with
the
countries
of
latin
america
adequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
a
rapidly
increasing
appreciation
of
the
reciprocal
dependence
of
the
countries
of
the
western
hemisphere
upon
each
others
products
sympathies
and
assistance
i
alluded
to
this
most
important
subject
in
my
last
annual
message
it
has
often
been
before
you
and
i
need
not
recapitulate
the
reasons
for
its
recommendation
unless
prompt
action
be
taken
the
completion
of
the
panama
canal
will
find
this
the
only
great
commercial
nation
unable
to
avail
in
international
maritime
business
of
this
great
improvement
in
the
means
of
the
worlds
commercial
intercourse
quite
aside
from
the
commercial
aspect
unless
we
create
a
merchant
marine
where
can
we
find
the
seafaring
population
necessary
as
a
natural
naval
reserve
and
where
could
we
find
in
case
of
war
the
transports
and
subsidiary
vessels
without
which
a
naval
fleet
is
arms
without
a
body
for
many
reasons
i
cannot
too
strongly
urge
upon
the
congress
the
passage
of
a
measure
by
mail
subsidy
or
other
subvention
adequate
to
guarantee
the
establishment
and
rapid
development
of
an
american
merchant
marine
and
the
restoration
of
the
american
flag
to
its
ancient
place
upon
the
seas
of
course
such
aid
ought
only
to
be
given
under
conditions
of
publicity
of
each
beneficiarys
business
and
accounts
which
would
show
that
the
aid
received
was
needed
to
maintain
the
trade
and
was
properly
used
for
that
purpose
federal
protection
to
aliens
with
our
increasing
international
intercourse
it
becomes
incumbent
upon
me
to
repeat
more
emphatically
than
ever
the
recommendation
which
i
made
in
my
inaugural
address
that
congress
shall
at
once
give
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
jurisdiction
to
punish
as
a
crime
the
violation
of
the
rights
of
aliens
secured
by
treaty
with
the
united
states
in
order
that
the
general
government
of
the
united
states
shall
be
able
when
called
upon
by
a
friendly
nation
to
redeem
its
solemn
promise
by
treaty
to
secure
to
the
citizens
or
subjects
of
that
nation
resident
in
the
united
states
freedom
from
violence
and
due
process
of
law
in
respect
to
their
life
liberty
and
property
merit
system
for
diplomatic
and
consular
service
i
also
strongly
commend
to
the
favorable
action
of
the
congress
the
enactment
of
a
law
applying
to
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
the
principles
embodied
in
section
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
united
states
in
the
civil
service
act
of
january
and
the
executive
orders
of
june
and
of
november
the
excellent
results
which
have
attended
the
partial
application
of
civil
service
principles
to
the
diplomatic
and
consular
services
are
an
earnest
of
the
benefit
to
be
wrought
by
a
wider
and
more
permanent
extension
of
those
principles
to
both
branches
of
the
foreign
service
the
marked
improvement
in
the
consular
service
during
the
four
years
since
the
principles
of
the
civil
service
act
were
applied
to
that
service
in
a
limited
way
and
the
good
results
already
noticeable
from
a
similar
application
of
civil
service
principles
to
the
diplomatic
service
a
year
ago
convince
me
that
the
enactment
into
law
of
the
general
principles
of
the
existing
executive
regulations
could
not
fail
to
effect
further
improvement
of
both
branches
of
the
foreign
service
offering
as
it
would
by
its
assurance
of
permanency
of
tenure
and
promotion
on
merit
an
inducement
for
the
entry
of
capable
young
men
into
the
service
and
an
incentive
to
those
already
in
to
put
forth
their
best
efforts
to
attain
and
maintain
that
degree
of
efficiency
which
the
interests
of
our
international
relations
and
commerce
demand
government
ownership
of
our
embassy
and
legation
premises
during
many
years
past
appeals
have
been
made
from
time
to
time
to
congress
in
favor
of
government
ownership
of
embassy
and
legation
premises
abroad
the
arguments
in
favor
of
such
ownership
have
been
many
and
oft
repeated
and
are
well
known
to
the
congress
the
acquisition
by
the
government
of
suitable
residences
and
offices
for
its
diplomatic
officers
especially
in
the
capitals
of
the
latinamerican
states
and
of
europe
is
so
important
and
necessary
to
an
improved
diplomatic
service
that
i
have
no
hesitation
in
urging
upon
the
congress
the
passage
of
some
measure
similar
to
that
favorably
reported
by
the
house
committee
on
foreign
affairs
on
february

the
work
of
the
diplomatic
service
is
devoid
of
partisanship
its
importance
should
appeal
to
every
american
citizen

should
receive
the
generous
consideration
of
the
congress
treasury
department
estimates
for

expenses
every
effort
has
been
made
by
each
department
chief
to
reduce
the
estimated
cost
of
his
department
for
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
ending
june
i
say
this
in
order
that
congress
may
understand
that
these
estimates
thus
made
present
the
smallest
sum
which
will
maintain
the
departments
bureaus
and
offices
of
the
government
and
meet
its
other
obligations
under
existing
law
and
that
a
cut
of
these
estimates
would
result
in
embarrassing
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
in
the
performance
of
its
duties
this
remark
does
not
apply
to
the
river
and
harbor
estimates
except
to
those
for
expenses
of
maintenance
and
the
meeting
of
obligations
under
authorized
contracts
nor
does
it
apply
to
the
public
building
bill
nor
to
the
navy
building
program
of
course
as
to
these
congress
could
withhold
any
part
or
all
of
the
estimates
for
them
without
interfering
with
the
discharge
of
the
ordinary
obligations
of
the
government
or
the
performance
of
the
functions
of
its
departments
bureaus
and
offices
a
fiftytwo
million
cut
the
final
estimates
for
the
year
ending
june
as
they
have
been
sent
to
the
treasury
on
november
of
this
year
for
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
including
those
for
public
buildings
rivers
and
harbors
and
the
navy
building
program
amount
to
this
is
less
than
the
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
it
is
less
than
the
total
estimates
including
supplemental
estimates
submitted
to
congress
by
the
treasury
for
the
year
and
is
less
than
the
original
estimates
submitted
by
the
treasury
for
these
figures
do
not
include
the
appropriations
for
the
panama
canal
the
policy
in
respect
to
which
ought
to
be
and
is
to
spend
as
much
each
year
as
can
be
economically
and
effectively
expended
in
order
to
complete
the
canal
as
promptly
as
possible
and
therefore
the
ordinary
motive
for
cutting
down
the
expense
of
the
government
does
not
apply
to
appropriations
for
this
purpose
it
will
be
noted
that
the
estimates
for
the
panama
canal
for
the
ensuing
year
are
more
than
fiftysix
millions
of
dollars
an
increase
of
twenty
millions
over
the
amount
appropriated
for
this
yeara
difference
due
to
the
fact
that
the
estimates
for
include
something
over
nineteen
millions
for
the
fortification
of
the
canal
against
the
estimated
expenditures
of
the
treasury
has
estimated
receipts
for
next
year
making
a
probable
surplus
of
ordinary
receipts
over
ordinary
expenditures
of
about
a
table
showing
in
detail
the
estimates
and
the
comparisons
referred
to
follows
typical
economies
the
treasury
department
is
one
of
the
original
departments
of
the
government
with
the
changes
in
the
monetary
system
made
from
time
to
time
and
with
the
creation
of
national
banks
it
was
thought
necessary
to
organize
new
bureaus
and
divisions
which
were
added
in
a
somewhat
haphazard
way
and
resulted
in
a
duplication
of
duties
which
might
well
now
be
ended
this
lack
of
system
and
economic
coordination
has
attracted
the
attention
of
the
head
of
that
department
who
has
been
giving
his
time
for
the
last
two
years
with
the
aid
of
experts
and
by
consulting
his
bureau
chiefs
to
its
reformation
he
has
abolished
four
hundred
places
in
the
civil
service
without
at
all
injuring
its
efficiency
merely
to
illustrate
the
character
of
the
reforms
that
are
possible
i
shall
comment
on
some
of
the
specific
changes
that
are
being
made
or
ought
to
be
made
by
legislative
aid
auditing
system
the
auditing
system
in
vogue
is
as
old
as
the
government
and
the
methods
used
are
antiquated
there
are
six
auditors
and
seven
assistant
auditors
for
the
nine
departments
and
under
the
present
system
the
only
function
which
the
auditor
of
a
department
exercises
is
to
determine
on
accounts
presented
by
disbursing
officers
that
the
object
of
the
expenditure
was
within
the
law
and
the
appropriation
made
by
congress
for
the
purpose
on
its
face
and
that
the
calculations
in
the
accounts
are
correct
he
does
not
examine
the
merits
of
the
transaction
or
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
price
paid
for
the
articles
purchased
nor
does
he
furnish
any
substantial
check
upon
disbursing
officers
and
the
heads
of
departments
or
bureaus
with
sufficient
promptness
to
enable
the
government
to
recoup
itself
in
full
measure
for
unlawful
expenditure
a
careful
plan
is
being
devised
and
will
be
presented
to
congress
with
the
recommendation
that
the
force
of
auditors
and
employees
under
them
be
greatly
reduced
thereby
effecting
substantial
economy
but
this
economy
will
be
small
compared
with
the
larger
economy
that
can
be
effected
by
consolidation
and
change
of
methods
the
possibilities
in
this
regard
have
been
shown
in
the
reduction
of
expenses
and
the
importance
of
methods
and
efficiency
in
the
office
of
the
auditor
for
the
post
office
department
who
without
in
the
slightest
degree
impairing
the
comprehensiveness
and

of
his
work
