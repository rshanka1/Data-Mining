fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
resuming
your
labors
in
the
service
of
the
people
it
is
a
subject
of
congratulation
that
there
has
been
no
period
in
our
past
history
when
all
the
elements
of
national
prosperity
have
been
so
fully
developed
since
your
last
session
no
afflicting
dispensation
has
visited
our
country
general
good
health
has
prevailed
abundance
has
crowned
the
toil
of
the
husbandman
and
labor
in
all
its
branches
is
receiving
an
ample
reward
while
education
science
and
the
arts
are
rapidly
enlarging
the
means
of
social
happiness
the
progress
of
our
country
in
her
career
of
greatness
not
only
in
the
vast
extension
of
our
territorial
limits
and
the
rapid
increase
of
our
population
but
in
resources
and
wealth
and
in
the
happy
condition
of
our
people
is
without
an
example
in
the
history
of
nations
as
the
wisdom
strength
and
beneficence
of
our
free
institutions
are
unfolded
every
day
adds
fresh
motives
to
contentment
and
fresh
incentives
to
patriotism
our
devout
and
sincere
acknowledgments
are
due
to
the
gracious
giver
of
all
good
for
the
numberless
blessings
which
our
beloved
country
enjoys
it
is
a
source
of
high
satisfaction
to
know
that
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
all
other
nations
with
a
single
exception
are
of
the
most
amicable
character
sincerely
attached
to
the
policy
of
peace
early
adopted
and
steadily
pursued
by
this
government
i
have
anxiously
desired
to
cultivate
and
cherish
friendship
and
commerce
with
every
foreign
power
the
spirit
and
habits
of
the
american
people
are
favorable
to
the
maintenance
of
such
international
harmony
in
adhering
to
this
wise
policy
a
preliminary
and
paramount
duty
obviously
consists
in
the
protection
of
our
national
interests
from
encroachment
or
sacrifice
and
our
national
honor
from
reproach
these
must
be
maintained
at
any
hazard
they
admit
of
no
compromise
or
neglect
and
must
be
scrupulously
and
constantly
guarded
in
their
vigilant
vindication
collision
and
conflict
with
foreign
powers
may
sometimes
become
unavoidable
such
has
been
our
scrupulous
adherence
to
the
dictates
of
justice
in
all
our
foreign
intercourse
that
though
steadily
and
rapidly
advancing
in
prosperity
and
power
we
have
given
no
just
cause
of
complaint
to
any
nation
and
have
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
peace
for
more
than
thirty
years
from
a
policy
so
sacred
to
humanity
and
so
salutary
in
its
effects
upon
our
political
system
we
should
never
be
induced
voluntarily
to
depart
the
existing
war
with
mexico
was
neither
desired
nor
provoked
by
the
united
states
on
the
contrary
all
honorable
means
were
resorted
to
to
avert
it
after
years
of
endurance
of
aggravated
and
unredressed
wrongs
on
our
part
mexico
in
violation
of
solemn
treaty
stipulations
and
of
every
principle
of
justice
recognized
by
civilized
nations
commenced
hostilities
and
thus
by
her
own
act
forced
the
war
upon
us
long
before
the
advance
of
our
army
to
the
left
bank
of
the
rio
grande
we
had
ample
cause
of
war
against
mexico
and
had
the
united
states
resorted
to
this
extremity
we
might
have
appealed
to
the
whole
civilized
world
for
the
justice
of
our
cause
i
deem
it
to
be
my
duty
to
present
to
you
on
the
present
occasion
a
condensed
review
of
the
injuries
we
had
sustained
of
the
causes
which
led
to
the
war
and
of
its
progress
since
its
commencement
this
is
rendered
the
more
necessary
because
of
the
misapprehensions
which
have
to
some
extent
prevailed
as
to
its
origin
and
true
character
the
war
has
been
represented
as
unjust
and
unnecessary
and
as
one
of
aggression
on
our
part
upon
a
weak
and
injured
enemy
such
erroneous
views
though
entertained
by
but
few
have
been
widely
and
extensively
circulated
not
only
at
home
but
have
been
spread
throughout
mexico
and
the
whole
world
a
more
effectual
means
could
not
have
been
devised
to
encourage
the
enemy
and
protract
the
war
than
to
advocate
and
adhere
to
their
cause
and
thus
give
them
aid
and
comfort
it
is
a
source
of
national
pride
and
exultation
that
the
great
body
of
our
people
have
thrown
no
such
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
government
in
prosecuting
the
war
successfully
but
have
shown
themselves
to
be
eminently
patriotic
and
ready
to
vindicate
their
countrys
honor
and
interests
at
any
sacrifice
the
alacrity
and
promptness
with
which
our
volunteer
forces
rushed
to
the
field
on
their
countrys
call
prove
not
only
their
patriotism
but
their
deep
conviction
that
our
cause
is
just
the
wrongs
which
we
have
suffered
from
mexico
almost
ever
since
she
became
an
independent
power
and
the
patient
endurance
with
which
we
have
borne
them
are
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
modern
civilized
nations
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
if
these
wrongs
had
been
resented
and
resisted
in
the
first
instance
the
present
war
might
have
been
avoided
one
outrage
however
permitted
to
pass
with
impunity
almost
necessarily
encouraged
the
perpetration
of
another
until
at
last
mexico
seemed
to
attribute
to
weakness
and
indecision
on
our
part
a
forbearance
which
was
the
offspring
of
magnanimity
and
of
a
sincere
desire
to
preserve
friendly
relations
with
a
sister
republic
scarcely
had
mexico
achieved
her
independence
which
the
united
states
were
the
first
among
the
nations
to
acknowledge
when
she
commenced
the
system
of
insult
and
spoliation
which
she
has
ever
since
pursued
our
citizens
engaged
in
lawful
commerce
were
imprisoned
their
vessels
seized
and
our
flag
insulted
in
her
ports
if
money
was
wanted
the
lawless
seizure
and
confiscation
of
our
merchant
vessels
and
their
cargoes
was
a
ready
resource
and
if
to
accomplish
their
purposes
it
became
necessary
to
imprison
the
owners
captains
and
crews
it
was
done
rulers
superseded
rulers
in
mexico
in
rapid
succession
but
still
there
was
no
change
in
this
system
of
depredation
the
government
of
the
united
states
made
repeated
reclamations
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
but
these
were
answered
by
the
perpetration
of
new
outrages
promises
of
redress
made
by
mexico
in
the
most
solemn
forms
were
postponed
or
evaded
the
files
and
records
of
the
department
of
state
contain
conclusive
proofs
of
numerous
lawless
acts
perpetrated
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
our
citizens
by
mexico
and
of
wanton
insults
to
our
national
flag
the
interposition
of
our
government
to
obtain
redress
was
again
and
again
invoked
under
circumstances
which
no
nation
ought
to
disregard
it
was
hoped
that
these
outrages
would
cease
and
that
mexico
would
be
restrained
by
the
laws
which
regulate
the
conduct
of
civilized
nations
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
after
the
treaty
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
of
the
th
of
april
was
concluded
between
the
two
republics
but
this
hope
soon
proved
to
be
vain
the
course
of
seizure
and
confiscation
of
the
property
of
our
citizens
the
violation
of
their
persons
and
the
insults
to
our
flag
pursued
by
mexico
previous
to
that
time
were
scarcely
suspended
for
even
a
brief
period
although
the
treaty
so
clearly
defines
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
respective
parties
that
it
is
impossible
to
misunderstand
or
mistake
them
in
less
than
seven
years
after
the
conclusion
of
that
treaty
our
grievances
had
become
so
intolerable
that
in
the
opinion
of
president
jackson
they
should
no
longer
be
endured
in
his
message
to
congress
in
february
he
presented
them
to
the
consideration
of
that
body
and
declared
that
the
length
of
time
since
some
of
the
injuries
have
been
committed
the
repeated
and
unavailing
applications
for
redress
the
wanton
character
of
some
of
the
outrages
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
our
citizens
upon
the
officers
and
flag
of
the
united
states
independent
of
recent
insults
to
this
government
and
people
by
the
late
extraordinary
mexican
minister
would
justify
in
the
eyes
of
all
nations
immediate
war
in
a
spirit
of
kindness
and
forbearance
however
he
recommended
reprisals
as
a
milder
mode
of
redress
he
declared
that
war
should
not
be
used
as
a
remedy
by
just
and
generous
nations
confiding
in
their
strength
for
injuries
committed
if
it
can
be
honorably
avoided
and
added
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
considering
the
present
embarrassed
condition
of
that
country
we
should
act
with
both
wisdom
and
moderation
by
giving
to
mexico
one
more
opportunity
to
atone
for
the
past
before
we
take
redress
into
our
own
hands
to
avoid
all
misconception
on
the
part
of
mexico
as
well
as
to
protect
our
own
national
character
from
reproach
this
opportunity
should
be
given
with
the
avowed
design
and
full
preparation
to
take
immediate
satisfaction
if
it
should
not
be
obtained
on
a
repetition
of
the
demand
for
it
to
this
end
i
recommend
that
an
act
be
passed
authorizing
reprisals
and
the
use
of
the
naval
force
of
the
united
states
by
the
executive
against
mexico
to
enforce
them
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
by
the
mexican
government
to
come
to
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
matters
in
controversy
between
us
upon
another
demand
thereof
made
from
on
board
out
of
our
vessels
of
war
on
the
coast
of
mexico
committees
of
both
houses
of
congress
to
which
this
message
of
the
president
was
referred
fully
sustained
his
views
of
the
character
of
the
wrongs
which
we
had
suffered
from
mexico
and
recommended
that
another
demand
for
redress
should
be
made
before
authorizing
war
or
reprisals
the
committee
on
foreign
relations
of
the
senate
in
their
report
say
after
such
a
demand
should
prompt
justice
be
refused
by
the
mexican
government
we
may
appeal
to
all
nations
not
only
for
the
equity
and
moderation
with
which
we
shall
have
acted
toward
a
sister
republic
but
for
the
necessity
which
will
then
compel
us
to
seek
redress
for
our
wrongs
either
by
actual
war
or
by
reprisals
the
subject
will
then
be
presented
before
congress
at
the
commencement
of
the
next
session
in
a
clear
and
distinct
form
and
the
committee
can
not
doubt
but
that
such
measures
will
be
immediately
adopted
as
may
be
necessary
to
vindicate
the
honor
of
the
country
and
insure
ample
reparation
to
our
injured
fellowcitizens
the
committee
on
foreign
affairs
of
the
house
of
representatives
made
a
similar
recommendation
in
their
report
they
say
that
they
fully
concur
with
the
president
that
ample
cause
exists
for
taking
redress
into
our
own
hands
and
believe
that
we
should
be
justified
in
the
opinion
of
other
nations
for
taking
such
a
step
but
they
are
willing
to
try
the
experiment
of
another
demand
made
in
the
most
solemn
form
upon
the
justice
of
the
mexican
government
before
any
further
proceedings
are
adopted
no
difference
of
opinion
upon
the
subject
is
believed
to
have
existed
in
congress
at
that
time
the
executive
and
legislative
departments
concurred
and
yet
such
has
been
our
forbearance
and
desire
to
preserve
peace
with
mexico
that
the
wrongs
of
which
we
then
complained
and
which
gave
rise
to
these
solemn
proceedings
not
only
remain
unredressed
to
this
day
but
additional
causes
of
complaint
of
an
aggravated
character
have
ever
since
been
accumulating
shortly
after
these
proceedings
a
special
messenger
was
dispatched
to
mexico
to
make
a
final
demand
for
redress
and
on
the
th
of
july
the
demand
was
made
the
reply
of
the
mexican
government
bears
date
on
the
th
of
the
same
month
and
contains
assurances
of
the
anxious
wish
of
the
mexican
government
not
to
delay
the
moment
of
that
final
and
equitable
adjustment
which
is
to
terminate
the
existing
difficulties
between
the
two
governments
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
which
may
contribute
to
the
most
speedy
and
equitable
determination
of
the
subjects
which
have
so
seriously
engaged
the
attention
of
the
american
government
that
the
mexican
government
would
adopt
as
the
only
guides
for
its
conduct
the
plainest
principles
of
public
right
the
sacred
obligations
imposed
by
international
law
and
the
religious
faith
of
treaties
and
that
whatever
reason
and
justice
may
dictate
respecting
each
case
will
be
done
the
assurance
was
further
given
that
the
decision
of
the
mexican
government
upon
each
cause
of
complaint
for
which
redress
had
been
demanded
should
be
communicated
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
the
mexican
minister
at
washington
these
solemn
assurances
in
answer
to
our
demand
for
redress
were
disregarded
by
making
them
however
mexico
obtained
further
delay
president
van
buren
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
of
the
th
of
december
states
that
although
the
larger
number
of
our
demands
for
redress
and
many
of
them
aggravated
cases
of
personal
wrongs
have
been
now
for
years
before
the
mexican
government
and
some
of
the
causes
of
national
complaint
and
those
of
the
most
offensive
character
admitted
of
immediate
simple
and
satisfactory
replies
it
is
only
within
a
few
days
past
that
any
specific
communication
in
answer
to
our
last
demand
made
five
months
ago
has
been
received
from
the
mexican
minister
and
that
for
not
one
of
our
public
complaints
has
satisfaction
been
given
or
offered
that
but
one
of
the
cases
of
personal
wrong
has
been
favorably
considered
and
that
but
four
cases
of
both
descriptions
out
of
all
those
formally
presented
and
earnestly
pressed
have
as
yet
been
decided
upon
by
the
mexican
government
president
van
buren
believing
that
it
would
be
vain
to
make
any
further
attempt
to
obtain
redress
by
the
ordinary
means
within
the
power
of
the
executive
communicated
this
opinion
to
congress
in
the
message
referred
to
in
which
he
said
on
a
careful
and
deliberate
examination
of
their
contents
of
the
correspondence
with
the
mexican
government
and
considering
the
spirit
manifested
by
the
mexican
government
it
has
become
my
painful
duty
to
return
the
subject
as
it
now
stands
to
congress
to
whom
it
belongs
to
decide
upon
the
time
the
mode
and
the
measure
of
redress
had
the
united
states
at
that
time
adopted
compulsory
measures
and
taken
redress
into
their
own
hands
all
our
difficulties
with
mexico
would
probably
have
been
long
since
adjusted
and
the
existing
war
have
been
averted
magnanimity
and
moderation
on
our
part
only
had
the
effect
to
complicate
these
difficulties
and
render
an
amicable
settlement
of
them
the
more
embarrassing
that
such
measures
of
redress
under
similar
provocations
committed
by
any
of
the
powerful
nations
of
europe
would
have
been
promptly
resorted
to
by
the
united
states
can
not
be
doubted
the
national
honor
and
the
preservation
of
the
national
character
throughout
the
world
as
well
as
our
own
selfrespect
and
the
protection
due
to
our
own
citizens
would
have
rendered
such
a
resort
indispensable
the
history
of
no
civilized
nation
in
modern
times
has
presented
within
so
brief
a
period
so
many
wanton
attacks
upon
the
honor
of
its
flag
and
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
its
citizens
as
had
at
that
time
been
borne
by
the
united
states
from
the
mexican
authorities
and
people
but
mexico
was
a
sister
republic
on
the
north
american
continent
occupying
a
territory
contiguous
to
our
own
and
was
in
a
feeble
and
distracted
condition
and
these
considerations
it
is
presumed
induced
congress
to
forbear
still
longer
instead
of
taking
redress
into
our
own
hands
a
new
negotiation
was
entered
upon
with
fair
promises
on
the
part
of
mexico
but
with
the
real
purpose
as
the
event
has
proved
of
indefinitely
postponing
the
reparation
which
we
demanded
and
which
was
so
justly
due
this
negotiation
after
more
than
a
years
delay
resulted
in
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america
upon
the
government
of
the
mexican
republic
the
joint
board
of
commissioners
created
by
this
convention
to
examine
and
decide
upon
these
claims
was
not
organized
until
the
month
of
august
and
under
the
terms
of
the
convention
they
were
to
terminate
their
duties
within
eighteen
months
from
that
time
four
of
the
eighteen
months
were
consumed
in
preliminary
discussions
on
frivolous
and
dilatory
points
raised
by
the
mexican
commissioners
and
it
was
not
until
the
month
of
december
that
they
commenced
the
examination
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
mexico
fourteen
months
only
remained
to
examine
and
decide
upon
these
numerous
and
complicated
cases
in
the
month
of
february
the
term
of
the
commission
expired
leaving
many
claims
undisposed
of
for
want
of
time
the
claims
which
were
allowed
by
the
board
and
by
the
umpire
authorized
by
the
convention
to
decide
in
case
of
disagreement
between
the
mexican
and
american
commissioners
amounted
to
there
were
pending
before
the
umpire
when
the
commission
expired
additional
claims
which
had
been
examined
and
awarded
by
the
american
commissioners
and
had
not
been
allowed
by
the
mexican
commissioners
amounting
to
upon
which
he
did
not
decide
alleging
that
his
authority
had
ceased
with
the
termination
of
the
joint
commission
besides
these
claims
there
were
others
of
american
citizens
amounting
to
which
had
been
submitted
to
the
board
and
upon
which
they
had
not
time
to
decide
before
their
final
adjournment
the
sum
of
which
had
been
awarded
to
the
claimants
was
a
liquidated
and
ascertained
debt
due
by
mexico
about
which
there
could
be
no
dispute
and
which
she
was
bound
to
pay
according
to
the
terms
of
the
convention
soon
after
the
final
awards
for
this
amount
had
been
made
the
mexican
government
asked
for
a
postponement
of
the
time
of
making
payment
alleging
that
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
make
the
payment
at
the
time
stipulated
in
the
spirit
of
forbearing
kindness
toward
a
sister
republic
which
mexico
has
so
long
abused
the
united
states
promptly
complied
with
her
request
a
second
convention
was
accordingly
concluded
between
the
two
governments
on
the
th
of
january
which
upon
its
face
declares
that
this
new
arrangement
is
entered
into
for
the
accommodation
of
mexico
by
the
terms
of
this
convention
all
the
interest
due
on
the
awards
which
had
been
made
in
favor
of
the
claimants
under
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
was
to
be
paid
to
them
on
the
th
of
april
and
the
principal
of
the
said
awards
and
the
interest
accruing
thereon
was
stipulated
to
be
paid
in
five
years
in
equal
installments
every
three
months
notwithstanding
this
new
convention
was
entered
into
at
the
request
of
mexico
and
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
her
from
embarrassment
the
claimants
have
only
received
the
interest
due
on
the
th
of
april
and
three
of
the
twenty
installments
although
the
payment
of
the
sum
thus
liquidated
and
confessedly
due
by
mexico
to
our
citizens
as
indemnity
for
acknowledged
acts
of
outrage
and
wrong
was
secured
by
treaty
the
obligations
of
which
are
ever
held
sacred
by
all
just
nations
yet
mexico
has
violated
this
solemn
engagement
by
failing
and
refusing
to
make
the
payment
the
two
installments
due
in
april
and
july
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
connected
with
them
have
been
assumed
by
the
united
states
and
discharged
to
the
claimants
but
they
are
still
due
by
mexico
but
this
is
not
all
of
which
we
have
just
cause
of
complaint
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
claimants
whose
cases
were
not
decided
by
the
joint
commission
under
the
convention
of
april
it
was
expressly
stipulated
by
the
sixth
article
of
the
convention
of
the
th
of
january
that
a
new
convention
shall
be
entered
into
for
the
settlement
of
all
claims
of
the
government
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
the
republic
of
mexico
which
were
not
finally
decided
by
the
late
commission
which
met
in
the
city
of
washington
and
of
all
claims
of
the
government
and
citizens
of
mexico
against
the
united
states
in
conformity
with
this
stipulation
a
third
convention
was
concluded
and
signed
at
the
city
of
mexico
on
the
th
of
november
by
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
two
governments
by
which
provision
was
made
for
ascertaining
and
paying
these
claims
in
january
this
convention
was
ratified
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
with
two
amendments
which
were
manifestly
reasonable
in
their
character
upon
a
reference
of
the
amendments
proposed
to
the
government
of
mexico
the
same
evasions
difficulties
and
delays
were
interposed
which
have
so
long
marked
the
policy
of
that
government
toward
the
united
states
it
has
not
even
yet
decided
whether
it
would
or
would
not
accede
to
them
although
the
subject
has
been
repeatedly
pressed
upon
its
consideration
mexico
has
thus
violated
a
second
time
the
faith
of
treaties
by
failing
or
refusing
to
carry
into
effect
the
sixth
article
of
the
convention
of
january
such
is
the
history
of
the
wrongs
which
we
have
suffered
and
patiently
endured
from
mexico
through
a
long
series
of
years
so
far
from
affording
reasonable
satisfaction
for
the
injuries
and
insults
we
had
borne
a
great
aggravation
of
them
consists
in
the
fact
that
while
the
united
states
anxious
to
preserve
a
good
understanding
with
mexico
have
been
constantly
but
vainly
employed
in
seeking
redress
for
past
wrongs
new
outrages
were
constantly
occurring
which
have
continued
to
increase
our
causes
of
complaint
and
to
swell
the
amount
of
our
demands
while
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
were
conducting
a
lawful
commerce
with
mexico
under
the
guaranty
of
a
treaty
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
many
of
them
have
suffered
all
the
injuries
which
would
have
resulted
from
open
war
this
treaty
instead
of
affording
protection
to
our
citizens
has
been
the
means
of
inviting
them
into
the
ports
of
mexico
that
they
might
be
as
they
have
been
in
numerous
instances
plundered
of
their
property
and
deprived
of
their
personal
liberty
if
they
dared
insist
on
their
rights
had
the
unlawful
seizures
of
american
property
and
the
violation
of
the
personal
liberty
of
our
citizens
to
say
nothing
of
the
insults
to
our
flag
which
have
occurred
in
the
ports
of
mexico
taken
place
on
the
high
seas
they
would
themselves
long
since
have
constituted
a
state
of
actual
war
between
the
two
countries
in
so
long
suffering
mexico
to
violate
her
most
solemn
treaty
obligations
plunder
our
citizens
of
their
property
and
imprison
their
persons
without
affording
them
any
redress
we
have
failed
to
perform
one
of
the
first
and
highest
duties
which
every
government
owes
to
its
citizens
and
the
consequence
has
been
that
many
of
them
have
been
reduced
from
a
state
of
affluence
to
bankruptcy
the
proud
name
of
american
citizen
which
ought
to
protect
all
who
bear
it
from
insult
and
injury
throughout
the
world
has
afforded
no
such
protection
to
our
citizens
in
mexico
we
had
ample
cause
of
war
against
mexico
long
before
the
breaking
out
of
hostilities
but
even
then
we
forbore
to
take
redress
into
our
own
hands
until
mexico
herself
became
the
aggressor
by
invading
our
soil
in
hostile
array
and
shedding
the
blood
of
our
citizens
such
are
the
grave
causes
of
complaint
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
against
mexicocauses
which
existed
long
before
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
american
union
and
yet
animated
by
the
love
of
peace
and
a
magnanimous
moderation
we
did
not
adopt
those
measures
of
redress
which
under
such
circumstances
are
the
justified
resort
of
injured
nations
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
constituted
no
just
cause
of
offense
to
mexico
the
pretext
that
it
did
so
is
wholly
inconsistent
and
irreconcilable
with
wellauthenticated
facts
connected
with
the
revolution
by
which
texas
became
independent
of
mexico
that
this
may
be
the
more
manifest
it
may
be
proper
to
advert
to
the
causes
and
to
the
history
of
the
principal
events
of
that
revolution
texas
constituted
a
portion
of
the
ancient
province
of
louisiana
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
in
the
year
in
the
year
the
united
states
by
the
florida
treaty
ceded
to
spain
all
that
part
of
louisiana
within
the
present
limits
of
texas
and
mexico
by
the
revolution
which
separated
her
from
spain
and
rendered
her
an
independent
nation
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
mother
country
over
this
territory
in
the
year
mexico
established
a
federal
constitution
under
which
the
mexican
republic
was
composed
of
a
number
of
sovereign
states
confederated
together
in
a
federal
union
similar
to
our
own
each
of
these
states
had
its
own
executive
legislature
and
judiciary
and
for
all
except
federal
purposes
was
as
independent
of
the
general
government
and
that
of
the
other
states
as
is
pennsylvania
or
virginia
under
our
constitution
texas
and
coahuila
united
and
formed
one
of
these
mexican
states
the
state
constitution
which
they
adopted
and
which
was
approved
by
the
mexican
confederacy
asserted
that
they
were
free
and
independent
of
the
other
mexican
united
states
and
of
every
other
power
and
dominion
whatsoever
and
proclaimed
the
great
principle
of
human
liberty
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
resides
originally
and
essentially
in
the
general
mass
of
the
individuals
who
compose
it
to
the
government
under
this
constitution
as
well
as
to
that
under
the
federal
constitution
the
people
of
texas
owed
allegiance
emigrants
from
foreign
countries
including
the
united
states
were
invited
by
the
colonization
laws
of
the
state
and
of
the
federal
government
to
settle
in
texas
advantageous
terms
were
offered
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
own
country
and
become
mexican
citizens
this
invitation
was
accepted
by
many
of
our
citizens
in
the
full
faith
that
in
their
new
home
they
would
be
governed
by
laws
enacted
by
representatives
elected
by
themselves
and
that
their
lives
liberty
and
property
would
be
protected
by
constitutional
guaranties
similar
to
those
which
existed
in
the
republic
they
had
left
under
a
government
thus
organized
they
continued
until
the
year
when
a
military
revolution
broke
out
in
the
city
of
mexico
which
entirely
subverted
the
federal
and
state
constitutions
and
placed
a
military
dictator
at
the
head
of
the
government
by
a
sweeping
decree
of
a
congress
subservient
to
the
will
of
the
dictator
the
several
state
constitutions
were
abolished
and
the
states
themselves
converted
into
mere
departments
of
the
central
government
the
people
of
texas
were
unwilling
to
submit
to
this
usurpation
resistance
to
such
tyranny
became
a
high
duty
texas
was
fully
absolved
from
all
allegiance
to
the
central
government
of
mexico
from
the
moment
that
government
had
abolished
her
state
constitution
and
in
its
place
substituted
an
arbitrary
and
despotic
central
government
such
were
the
principal
causes
of
the
texan
revolution
the
people
of
texas
at
once
determined
upon
resistance
and
flew
to
arms
in
the
midst
of
these
important
and
exciting
events
however
they
did
not
omit
to
place
their
liberties
upon
a
secure
and
permanent
foundation
they
elected
members
to
a
convention
who
in
the
month
of
march
issued
a
formal
declaration
that
their
political
connection
with
the
mexican
nation
has
forever
ended
and
that
the
people
of
texas
do
now
constitute
a
free
sovereign
and
independent
republic
and
are
fully
invested
with
all
the
rights
and
attributes
which
properly
belong
to
independent
nations
they
also
adopted
for
their
government
a
liberal
republican
constitution
about
the
same
time
santa
anna
then
the
dictator
of
mexico
invaded
texas
with
a
numerous
army
for
the
purpose
of
subduing
her
people
and
enforcing
obedience
to
his
arbitrary
and
despotic
government
on
the
st
of
april
he
was
met
by
the
texan
citizen
soldiers
and
on
that
day
was
achieved
by
them
the
memorable
victory
of
san
jacinto
by
which
they
conquered
their
independence
considering
the
numbers
engaged
on
the
respective
sides
history
does
not
record
a
more
brilliant
achievement
santa
anna
himself
was
among
the
captives
in
the
month
of
may
santa
anna
acknowledged
by
a
treaty
with
the
texan
authorities
in
the
most
solemn
form
the
full
entire
and
perfect
independence
of
the
republic
of
texas
it
is
true
he
was
then
a
prisoner
of
war
but
it
is
equally
true
that
he
had
failed
to
reconquer
texas
and
had
met
with
signal
defeat
that
his
authority
had
not
been
revoked
and
that
by
virtue
of
this
treaty
he
obtained
his
personal
release
by
it
hostilities
were
suspended
and
the
army
which
had
invaded
texas
under
his
command
returned
in
pursuance
of
this
arrangement
unmolested
to
mexico
from
the
day
that
the
battle
of
san
jacinto
was
fought
until
the
present
hour
mexico
has
never
possessed
the
power
to
reconquer
texas
in
the
language
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
in
a
dispatch
to
our
minister
in
mexico
under
date
of
the
th
of
july
mexico
may
have
chosen
to
consider
and
may
still
choose
to
consider
texas
as
having
been
at
all
times
since
and
as
still
continuing
a
rebellious
province
but
the
world
has
been
obliged
to
take
a
very
different
view
of
the
matter
from
the
time
of
the
battle
of
san
jacinto
in
april
to
the
present
moment
texas
has
exhibited
the
same
external
signs
of
national
independence
as
mexico
herself
and
with
quite
as
much
stability
of
government
practically
free
and
independent
acknowledged
as
a
political
sovereignty
by
the
principal
powers
of
the
world
no
hostile
foot
finding
rest
within
her
territory
for
six
or
seven
years
and
mexico
herself
refraining
for
all
that
period
from
any
further
attempt
to
reestablish
her
own
authority
over
that
territory
it
can
not
but
be
surprising
to
find
mr
de
bocanegra
the
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
of
mexico
complaining
that
for
that
whole
period
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
its
government
have
been
favoring
the
rebels
of
texas
and
supplying
them
with
vessels
ammunition
and
money
as
if
the
war
for
the
reduction
of
the
province
of
texas
had
been
constantly
prosecuted
by
mexico
and
her
success
prevented
by
these
influences
from
abroad
in
the
same
dispatch
the
secretary
of
state
affirms
that
since
the
united
states
have
regarded
texas
as
an
independent
sovereignty
as
much
as
mexico
and
that
trade
and
commerce
with
citizens
of
a
government
at
war
with
mexico
can
not
on
that
account
be
regarded
as
an
intercourse
by
which
assistance
and
succor
are
given
to
mexican
rebels
the
whole
current
of
mr
de
bocanegras
remarks
runs
in
the
same
direction
as
if
the
independence
of
texas
had
not
been
acknowledged
it
has
been
acknowledged
it
was
acknowledged
in
against
the
remonstrance
and
protest
of
mexico
and
most
of
the
acts
of
any
importance
of
which
mr
de
bocanegra
complains
flow
necessarily
from
that
recognition
he
speaks
of
texas
as
still
being
an
integral
part
of
the
territory
of
the
mexican
republic
but
he
can
not
but
understand
that
the
united
states
do
not
so
regard
it
the
real
complaint
of
mexico
therefore
is
in
substance
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
complaint
against
the
recognition
of
texan
independence
it
may
be
thought
rather
late
to
repeat
that
complaint
and
not
quite
just
to
confine
it
to
the
united
states
to
the
exemption
of
england
france
and
belgium
unless
the
united
states
having
been
the
first
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
mexico
herself
are
to
be
blamed
for
setting
an
example
for
the
recognition
of
that
of
texas
and
he
added
that
the
constitution
public
treaties
and
the
laws
oblige
the
president
to
regard
texas
as
an
independent
state
and
its
territory
as
no
part
of
the
territory
of
mexico
texas
had
been
an
independent
state
with
an
organized
government
defying
the
power
of
mexico
to
overthrow
or
reconquer
her
for
more
than
ten
years
before
mexico
commenced
the
present
war
against
the
united
states
texas
had
given
such
evidence
to
the
world
of
her
ability
to
maintain
her
separate
existence
as
an
independent
nation
that
she
had
been
formally
recognized
as
such
not
only
by
the
united
states
but
by
several
of
the
principal
powers
of
europe
these
powers
had
entered
into
treaties
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
with
her
they
had
received
and
accredited
her
ministers
and
other
diplomatic
agents
at
their
respective
courts
and
they
had
commissioned
ministers
and
diplomatic
agents
on
their
part
to
the
government
of
texas
if
mexico
notwithstanding
all
this
and
her
utter
inability
to
subdue
or
reconquer
texas
still
stubbornly
refused
to
recognize
her
as
an
independent
nation
she
was
none
the
less
so
on
that
account
mexico
herself
had
been
recognized
as
an
independent
nation
by
the
united
states
and
by
other
powers
many
years
before
spain
of
which
before
her
revolution
she
had
been
a
colony
would
agree
to
recognize
her
as
such
and
yet
mexico
was
at
that
time
in
the
estimation
of
the
civilized
world
and
in
fact
none
the
less
an
independent
power
because
spain
still
claimed
her
as
a
colony
if
spain
had
continued
until
the
present
period
to
assert
that
mexico
was
one
of
her
colonies
in
rebellion
against
her
this
would
not
have
made
her
so
or
changed
the
fact
of
her
independent
existence
texas
at
the
period
of
her
annexation
to
the
united
states
bore
the
same
relation
to
mexico
that
mexico
had
borne
to
spain
for
many
years
before
spain
acknowledged
her
independence
with
this
important
difference
that
before
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
was
consummated
mexico
herself
by
a
formal
act
of
her
government
had
acknowledged
the
independence
of
texas
as
a
nation
it
is
true
that
in
the
act
of
recognition
she
prescribed
a
condition
which
she
had
no
power
or
authority
to
imposethat
texas
should
not
annex
herself
to
any
other
powerbut
this
could
not
detract
in
any
degree
from
the
recognition
which
mexico
then
made
of
her
actual
independence
upon
this
plain
statement
of
facts
it
is
absurd
for
mexico
to
allege
as
a
pretext
for
commencing
hostilities
against
the
united
states
that
texas
is
still
a
part
of
her
territory
but
there
are
those
who
conceding
all
this
to
be
true
assume
the
ground
that
the
true
western
boundary
of
texas
is
the
nueces
instead
of
the
rio
grande
and
that
therefore
in
marching
our
army
to
the
east
bank
of
the
latter
river
we
passed
the
texan
line
and
invaded
the
territory
of
mexico
a
simple
statement
of
facts
known
to
exist
will
conclusively
refute
such
an
assumption
texas
as
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
in
has
been
always
claimed
as
extending
west
to
the
rio
grande
or
rio
bravo
this
fact
is
established
by
the
authority
of
our
most
eminent
statesmen
at
a
period
when
the
question
was
as
well
if
not
better
understood
than
it
is
at
present
during
mr
jeffersons
administration
messrs
monroe
and
pinckney
who
had
been
sent
on
a
special
mission
to
madrid
charged
among
other
things
with
the
adjustment
of
boundary
between
the
two
countries
in
a
note
addressed
to
the
spanish
minister
of
foreign
affairs
under
date
of
the
th
of
january
assert
that
the
boundaries
of
louisiana
as
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
are
the
river
perdido
on
the
east
and
the
river
bravo
on
the
west
and
they
add
that
the
facts
and
principles
which
justify
this
conclusion
are
so
satisfactory
to
our
government
as
to
convince
it
that
the
united
states
have
not
a
better
right
to
the
island
of
new
orleans
under
the
cession
referred
to
than
they
have
to
the
whole
district
of
territory
which
is
above
described
down
to
the
conclusion
of
the
florida
treaty
in
february
by
which
this
territory
was
ceded
to
spain
the
united
states
asserted
and
maintained
their
territorial
rights
to
this
extent
in
the
month
of
june
during
mr
monroes
administration
information
having
been
received
that
a
number
of
foreign
adventurers
had
landed
at
galveston
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
forming
a
settlement
in
that
vicinity
a
special
messenger
was
dispatched
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
instructions
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
warn
them
to
desist
should
they
be
found
there
or
any
other
place
north
of
the
rio
bravo
and
within
the
territory
claimed
by
the
united
states
he
was
instructed
should
they
be
found
in
the
country
north
of
that
river
to
make
known
to
them
the
surprise
with
which
the
president
has
seen
possession
thus
taken
without
authority
from
the
united
states
of
a
place
within
their
territorial
limits
and
upon
which
no
lawful
settlement
can
be
made
without
their
sanction
he
was
instructed
to
call
upon
them
to
avow
under
what
national
authority
they
profess
to
act
and
to
give
them
due
warning
that
the
place
is
within
the
united
states
who
will
suffer
no
permanent
settlement
to
be
made
there
under
any
authority
other
than
their
own
as
late
as
the
th
of
july
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
in
a
note
addressed
to
our
minister
in
mexico
maintains
that
by
the
florida
treaty
of
the
territory
as
far
west
as
the
rio
grande
was
confirmed
to
spain
in
that
note
he
states
that
by
the
treaty
of
the
d
of
february
between
the
united
states
and
spain
the
sabine
was
adopted
as
the
line
of
boundary
between
the
two
powers
up
to
that
period
no
considerable
colonization
had
been
effected
in
texas
but
the
territory
between
the
sabine
and
the
rio
grande
being
confirmed
to
spain
by
the
treaty
applications
were
made
to
that
power
for
grants
of
land
and
such
grants
or
permissions
of
settlement
were
in
fact
made
by
the
spanish
authorities
in
favor
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
proposing
to
emigrate
to
texas
in
numerous
families
before
the
declaration
of
independence
by
mexico
the
texas
which
was
ceded
to
spain
by
the
florida
treaty
of
embraced
all
the
country
now
claimed
by
the
state
of
texas
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
the
republic
of
texas
always
claimed
this
river
as
her
western
boundary
and
in
her
treaty
made
with
santa
anna
in
may
he
recognized
it
as
such
by
the
constitution
which
texas
adopted
in
march
senatorial
and
representative
districts
were
organized
extending
west
of
the
nueces
the
congress
of
texas
on
the
th
of
december
passed
an
act
to
define
the
boundaries
of
the
republic
of
texas
in
which
they
declared
the
rio
grande
from
its
mouth
to
its
source
to
be
their
boundary
and
by
the
said
act
they
extended
their
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
over
the
country
up
to
that
boundary
during
a
period
of
more
than
nine
years
which
intervened
between
the
adoption
of
her
constitution
and
her
annexation
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
texas
asserted
and
exercised
many
acts
of
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
over
the
territory
and
inhabitants
west
of
the
nueces
she
organized
and
defined
the
limits
of
counties
extending
to
the
rio
grande
she
established
courts
of
justice
and
extended
her
judicial
system
over
the
territory
she
established
a
customhouse
and
collected
duties
and
also
postoffices
and
postroads
in
it
she
established
a
land
office
and
issued
numerous
grants
for
land
within
its
limits
a
senator
and
a
representative
residing
in
it
were
elected
to
the
congress
of
the
republic
and
served
as
such
before
the
act
of
annexation
took
place
in
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
texas
which
gave
their
assent
to
the
terms
of
annexation
to
the
united
states
proposed
by
our
congress
were
representatives
residing
west
of
the
nueces
who
took
part
in
the
act
of
annexation
itself
this
was
the
texas
which
by
the
act
of
our
congress
of
the
th
of
december
was
admitted
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
understood
the
state
of
texas
which
they
admitted
into
the
union
to
extend
beyond
the
nueces
is
apparent
from
the
fact
that
on
the
st
of
december
only
two
days
after
the
act
of
admission
they
passed
a
law
to
establish
a
collection
district
in
the
state
of
texas
by
which
they
created
a
port
of
delivery
at
corpus
christi
situated
west
of
the
nueces
and
being
the
same
point
at
which
the
texas
customhouse
under
the
laws
of
that
republic
had
been
located
and
directed
that
a
surveyor
to
collect
the
revenue
should
be
appointed
for
that
port
by
the
president
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
a
surveyor
was
accordingly
nominated
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
has
been
ever
since
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
all
these
acts
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
of
our
congress
preceded
the
orders
for
the
advance
of
our
army
to
the
east
bank
of
the
rio
grande
subsequently
congress
passed
an
act
establishing
certain
post
routes
extending
west
of
the
nueces
the
country
west
of
that
river
now
constitutes
a
part
of
one
of
the
congressional
districts
of
texas
and
is
represented
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
senators
from
that
state
were
chosen
by
a
legislature
in
which
the
country
west
of
that
river
was
represented
in
view
of
all
these
facts
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
upon
what
ground
it
can
be
maintained
that
in
occupying
the
country
west
of
the
nueces
with
our
army
with
a
view
solely
to
its
security
and
defense
we
invaded
the
territory
of
mexico
but
it
would
have
been
still
more
difficult
to
justify
the
executive
whose
duty
it
is
to
see
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
if
in
the
face
of
all
these
proceedings
both
of
the
congress
of
texas
and
of
the
united
states
he
had
assumed
the
responsibility
of
yielding
up
the
territory
west
of
the
nueces
to
mexico
or
of
refusing
to
protect
and
defend
this
territory
and
its
inhabitants
including
corpus
christi
as
well
as
the
remainder
of
texas
against
the
threatened
mexican
invasion
but
mexico
herself
has
never
placed
the
war
which
she
has
waged
upon
the
ground
that
our
army
occupied
the
intermediate
territory
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
her
refuted
pretension
that
texas
was
not
in
fact
an
independent
state
but
a
rebellious
province
was
obstinately
persevered
in
and
her
avowed
purpose
in
commencing
a
war
with
the
united
states
was
to
reconquer
texas
and
to
restore
mexican
authority
over
the
whole
territorynot
to
the
nueces
only
but
to
the
sabine
in
view
of
the
proclaimed
menaces
of
mexico
to
this
effect
i
deemed
it
my
duty
as
a
measure
of
precaution
and
defense
to
order
our
army
to
occupy
a
position
on
our
frontier
as
a
military
post
from
which
our
troops
could
best
resist
and
repel
any
attempted
invasion
which
mexico
might
make
our
army
had
occupied
a
position
at
corpus
christi
west
of
the
nueces
as
early
as
august
without
complaint
from
any
quarter
had
the
nueces
been
regarded
as
the
true
western
boundary
of
texas
that
boundary
had
been
passed
by
our
army
many
months
before
it
advanced
to
the
eastern
bank
of
the
rio
grande
in
my
annual
message
of
december
last
i
informed
congress
that
upon
the
invitation
of
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
texas
i
had
deemed
it
proper
to
order
a
strong
squadron
to
the
coasts
of
mexico
and
to
concentrate
an
efficient
military
force
on
the
western
frontier
of
texas
to
protect
and
defend
the
inhabitants
against
the
menaced
invasion
of
mexico
in
that
message
i
informed
congress
that
the
moment
the
terms
of
annexation
offered
by
the
united
states
were
accepted
by
texas
the
latter
became
so
far
a
part
of
our
own
country
as
to
make
it
our
duty
to
afford
such
protection
and
defense
and
that
for
that
purpose
our
squadron
had
been
ordered
to
the
gulf
and
our
army
to
take
a
position
between
the
nueces
and
the
del
norte
or
rio
grande
and
to
repel
any
invasion
of
the
texan
territory
which
might
be
attempted
by
the
mexican
forces
it
was
deemed
proper
to
issue
this
order
because
soon
after
the
president
of
texas
in
april
had
issued
his
proclamation
convening
the
congress
of
that
republic
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
to
that
body
the
terms
of
annexation
proposed
by
the
united
states
the
government
of
mexico
made
serious
threats
of
invading
the
texan
territory
these
threats
became
more
imposing
as
it
became
more
apparent
in
the
progress
of
the
question
that
the
people
of
texas
would
decide
in
favor
of
accepting
the
terms
of
annexation
and
finally
they
had
assumed
such
a
formidable
character
as
induced
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
texas
to
request
that
a
military
force
should
be
sent
by
the
united
states
into
her
territory
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
and
defending
her
against
the
threatened
invasion
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
good
faith
toward
the
people
of
texas
to
have
refused
to
afford
the
aid
which
they
desired
against
a
threatened
invasion
to
which
they
had
been
exposed
by
their
free
determination
to
annex
themselves
to
our
union
in
compliance
with
the
overture
made
to
them
by
the
joint
resolution
of
our
congress
accordingly
a
portion
of
the
army
was
ordered
to
advance
into
texas
corpus
christi
was
the
position
selected
by
general
taylor
he
encamped
at
that
place
in
august
and
the
army
remained
in
that
position
until
the
th
of
march
when
it
moved
westward
and
on
the
th
of
that
month
reached
the
east
bank
of
the
rio
grande
opposite
to
matamoras
this
movement
was
made
in
pursuance
of
orders
from
the
war
department
issued
on
the
th
of
january
before
these
orders
were
issued
the
dispatch
of
our
minister
in
mexico
transmitting
the
decision
of
the
council
of
government
of
mexico
advising
that
he
should
not
be
received
and
also
the
dispatch
of
our
consul
residing
in
the
city
of
mexico
the
former
bearing
date
on
the
th
and
the
latter
on
the
th
of
december
copies
of
both
of
which
accompanied
my
message
to
congress
of
the
th
of
may
last
were
received
at
the
department
of
state
these
communications
rendered
it
highly
probable
if
not
absolutely
certain
that
our
minister
would
not
be
received
by
the
government
of
general
herrera
it
was
also
well
known
that
but
little
hope
could
be
entertained
of
a
different
result
from
general
paredes
in
case
the
revolutionary
movement
which
he
was
prosecuting
should
prove
successful
as
was
highly
probable
the
partisans
of
paredes
as
our
minister
in
the
dispatch
referred
to
states
breathed
the
fiercest
hostility
against
the
united
states
denounced
the
proposed
negotiation
as
treason
and
openly
called
upon
the
troops
and
the
people
to
put
down
the
government
of
herrera
by
force
the
reconquest
of
texas
and
war
with
the
united
states
were
openly
threatened
these
were
the
circumstances
existing
when
it
was
deemed
proper
to
order
the
army
under
the
command
of
general
taylor
to
advance
to
the
western
frontier
of
texas
and
occupy
a
position
on
or
near
the
rio
grande
the
apprehensions
of
a
contemplated
mexican
invasion
have
been
since
fully
justified
by
the
event
the
determination
of
mexico
to
rush
into
hostilities
with
the
united
states
was
afterwards
manifested
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
note
of
the
mexican
minister
of
foreign
affairs
to
our
minister
bearing
date
on
the
th
of
march
paredes
had
then
revolutionized
the
government
and
his
minister
after
referring
to
the
resolution
for
the
annexation
of
texas
which
had
been
adopted
by
our
congress
in
march
proceeds
to
declare
that
a
fact
such
as
this
or
to
speak
with
greater
exactness
so
notable
an
act
of
usurpation
created
an
imperious
necessity
that
mexico
for
her
own
honor
should
repel
it
with
proper
firmness
and
dignity
the
supreme
government
had
beforehand
declared
that
it
would
look
upon
such
an
act
as
a
casus
belli
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
declaration
negotiation
was
by
its
very
nature
at
an
end
and
war
was
the
only
recourse
of
the
mexican
government
it
appears
also
that
on
the
th
of
april
following
general
paredes
through
his
minister
of
war
issued
orders
to
the
mexican
general
in
command
on
the
texan
frontier
to
attack
our
army
by
every
means
which
war
permits
to
this
general
paredes
had
been
pledged
to
the
army
and
people
of
mexico
during
the
military
revolution
which
had
brought
him
into
power
on
the
th
of
april
general
paredes
addressed
a
letter
to
the
commander
on
that
frontier
in
which
he
stated
to
him
at
the
present
date
i
suppose
you
at
the
head
of
that
valiant
army
either
fighting
already
or
preparing
for
the
operations
of
a
campaign
and
supposing
you
already
on
the
theater
of
operations
and
with
all
the
forces
assembled
it
is
indispensable
that
hostilities
be
commenced
yourself
taking
the
initiative
against
the
enemy
the
movement
of
our
army
to
the
rio
grande
was
made
by
the
commanding
general
under
positive
orders
to
abstain
from
all
aggressive
acts
toward
mexico
or
mexican
citizens
and
to
regard
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
as
peaceful
unless
mexico
should
declare
war
or
commit
acts
of
hostility
indicative
of
a
state
of
war
and
these
orders
he
faithfully
executed
whilst
occupying
his
position
on
the
east
bank
of
the
rio
grande
within
the
limits
of
texas
then
recently
admitted
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
the
commanding
general
of
the
mexican
forces
who
in
pursuance
of
the
orders
of
his
government
had
collected
a
large
army
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
rio
grande
crossed
the
river
invaded
our
territory
and
commenced
hostilities
by
attacking
our
forces
thus
after
all
the
injuries
which
we
had
received
and
borne
from
mexico
and
after
she
had
insultingly
rejected
a
minister
sent
to
her
on
a
mission
of
peace
and
whom
she
had
solemnly
agreed
to
receive
she
consummated
her
long
course
of
outrage
against
our
country
by
commencing
an
offensive
war
and
shedding
the
blood
of
our
citizens
on
our
own
soil
the
united
states
never
attempted
to
acquire
texas
by
conquest
on
the
contrary
at
an
early
period
after
the
people
of
texas
had
achieved
their
independence
they
sought
to
be
annexed
to
the
united
states
at
a
general
election
in
september
they
decided
with
great
unanimity
in
favor
of
annexation
and
in
november
following
the
congress
of
the
republic
authorized
the
appointment
of
a
minister
to
bear
their
request
to
this
government
this
government
however
having
remained
neutral
between
texas
and
mexico
during
the
war
between
them
and
considering
it
due
to
the
honor
of
our
country
and
our
fair
fame
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
that
we
should
not
at
this
early
period
consent
to
annexation
nor
until
it
should
be
manifest
to
the
whole
world
that
the
reconquest
of
texas
by
mexico
was
impossible
refused
to
accede
to
the
overtures
made
by
texas
on
the
th
of
april
after
more
than
seven
years
had
elapsed
since
texas
had
established
her
independence
a
treaty
was
concluded
for
the
annexation
of
that
republic
to
the
united
states
which
was
rejected
by
the
senate
finally
on
the
st
of
march
congress
passed
a
joint
resolution
for
annexing
her
to
the
united
states
upon
certain
preliminary
conditions
to
which
her
assent
was
required
the
solemnities
which
characterized
the
deliberations
and
conduct
of
the
government
and
people
of
texas
on
the
deeply
interesting
questions
presented
by
these
resolutions
are
known
to
the
world
the
congress
the
executive
and
the
people
of
texas
in
a
convention
elected
for
that
purpose
accepted
with
great
unanimity
the
proposed
terms
of
annexation
and
thus
consummated
on
her
part
the
great
act
of
restoring
to
our
federal
union
a
vast
territory
which
had
been
ceded
to
spain
by
the
florida
treaty
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
after
the
joint
resolution
for
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
had
been
passed
by
our
congress
the
mexican
minister
at
washington
addressed
a
note
to
the
secretary
of
state
bearing
date
on
the
th
of
march
protesting
against
it
as
an
act
of
aggression
the
most
unjust
which
can
be
found
recorded
in
the
annals
of
modern
history
namely
that
of
despoiling
a
friendly
nation
like
mexico
of
a
considerable
portion
of
her
territory
and
protesting
against
the
resolution
of
annexation
as
being
an
act
whereby
the
province
of
texas
an
integral
portion
of
the
mexican
territory
is
agreed
and
admitted
into
the
american
union
and
he
announced
that
as
a
consequence
his
mission
to
the
united
states
had
terminated
and
demanded
his
passports
which
were
granted
it
was
upon
the
absurd
pretext
made
by
mexico
herself
indebted
for
her
independence
to
a
successful
revolution
that
the
republic
of
texas
still
continued
to
be
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
a
province
of
mexico
that
this
step
was
taken
by
the
mexican
minister
every
honorable
effort
has
been
used
by
me
to
avoid
the
war
which
followed
but
all
have
proved
vain
all
our
attempts
to
preserve
peace
have
been
met
by
insult
and
resistance
on
the
part
of
mexico
my
efforts
to
this
end
commenced
in
the
note
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
th
of
march
in
answer
to
that
of
the
mexican
minister
whilst
declining
to
reopen
a
discussion
which
had
already
been
exhausted
and
proving
again
what
was
known
to
the
whole
world
that
texas
had
long
since
achieved
her
independence
the
secretary
of
state
expressed
the
regret
of
this
government
that
mexico
should
have
taken
offense
at
the
resolution
of
annexation
passed
by
congress
and
gave
assurance
that
our
most
strenuous
efforts
shall
be
devoted
to
the
amicable
adjustment
of
every
cause
of
complaint
between
the
two
governments
and
to
the
cultivation
of
the
kindest
and
most
friendly
relations
between
the
sister
republics
that
i
have
acted
in
the
spirit
of
this
assurance
will
appear
from
the
events
which
have
since
occurred
notwithstanding
mexico
had
abruptly
terminated
all
diplomatic
intercourse
with
the
united
states
and
ought
therefore
to
have
been
the
first
to
ask
for
its
resumption
yet
waiving
all
ceremony
i
embraced
the
earliest
favorable
opportunity
to
ascertain
from
the
mexican
government
whether
they
would
receive
an
envoy
from
the
united
states
intrusted
with
full
power
to
adjust
all
the
questions
in
dispute
between
the
two
governments
in
september
i
believed
the
propitious
moment
for
such
an
overture
had
arrived
texas
by
the
enthusiastic
and
almost
unanimous
will
of
her
people
had
pronounced
in
favor
of
annexation
mexico
herself
had
agreed
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
texas
subject
to
a
condition
it
is
true
which
she
had
no
right
to
impose
and
no
power
to
enforce
the
last
lingering
hope
of
mexico
if
she
still
could
have
retained
any
that
texas
would
ever
again
become
one
of
her
provinces
must
have
been
abandoned
the
consul
of
the
united
states
at
the
city
of
mexico
was
therefore
instructed
by
the
secretary
of
state
on
the
th
of
september
to
make
the
inquiry
of
the
mexican
government
the
inquiry
was
made
and
on
the
th
of
october
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
the
mexican
government
in
a
note
addressed
to
our
consul
gave
a
favorable
response
requesting
at
the
same
time
that
our
naval
force
might
be
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
while
negotiations
should
be
pending
upon
the
receipt
of
this
note
our
naval
force
was
promptly
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
a
minister
was
immediately
appointed
and
departed
to
mexico
everything
bore
a
promising
aspect
for
a
speedy
and
peaceful
adjustment
of
all
our
difficulties
at
the
date
of
my
annual
message
to
congress
in
december
last
no
doubt
was
entertained
but
that
he
would
be
received
by
the
mexican
government
and
the
hope
was
cherished
that
all
cause
of
misunderstanding
between
the
two
countries
would
be
speedily
removed
in
the
confident
hope
that
such
would
be
the
result
of
his
mission
i
informed
congress
that
i
forbore
at
that
time
to
recommend
such
ulterior
measures
of
redress
for
the
wrongs
and
injuries
we
had
so
long
borne
as
it
would
have
been
proper
to
make
had
no
such
negotiation
been
instituted
to
my
surprise
and
regret
the
mexican
government
though
solemnly
pledged
to
do
so
upon
the
arrival
of
our
minister
in
mexico
refused
to
receive
and
accredit
him
when
he
reached
vera
cruz
on
the
th
of
november
he
found
that
the
aspect
of
affairs
had
undergone
an
unhappy
change
the
government
of
general
herrera
who
was
at
that
time
president
of
the
republic
was
tottering
to
its
fall
general
paredes
a
military
leader
had
manifested
his
determination
to
overthrow
the
government
of
herrera
by
a
military
revolution
and
one
of
the
principal
means
which
he
employed
to
effect
his
purpose
and
render
the
government
of
herrera
odious
to
the
army
and
people
of
mexico
was
by
loudly
condemning
its
determination
to
receive
a
minister
of
peace
from
the
united
states
alleging
that
it
was
the
intention
of
herrera
by
a
treaty
with
the
united
states
to
dismember
the
territory
of
mexico
by
ceding
away
the
department
of
texas
the
government
of
herrera
is
believed
to
have
been
well
disposed
to
a
pacific
adjustment
of
existing
difficulties
but
probably
alarmed
for
its
own
security
and
in
order
to
ward
off
the
danger
of
the
revolution
led
by
paredes
violated
its
solemn
agreement
and
refused
to
receive
or
accredit
our
minister
and
this
although
informed
that
he
had
been
invested
with
full
power
to
adjust
all
questions
in
dispute
between
the
two
governments
among
the
frivolous
pretexts
for
this
refusal
the
principal
one
was
that
our
minister
had
not
gone
upon
a
special
mission
confined
to
the
question
of
texas
alone
leaving
all
the
outrages
upon
our
flag
and
our
citizens
unredressed
the
mexican
government
well
knew
that
both
our
national
honor
and
the
protection
due
to
our
citizens
imperatively
required
that
the
two
questions
of
boundary
and
indemnity
should
be
treated
of
together
as
naturally
and
inseparably
blended
and
they
ought
to
have
seen
that
this
course
was
best
calculated
to
enable
the
united
states
to
extend
to
them
the
most
liberal
justice
on
the
th
of
december
general
herrera
resigned
the
presidency
and
yielded
up
the
government
to
general
paredes
without
a
struggle
thus
a
revolution
was
accomplished
solely
by
the
army
commanded
by
paredes
and
the
supreme
power
in
mexico
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
military
usurper
who
was
known
to
be
bitterly
hostile
to
the
united
states
although
the
prospect
of
a
pacific
adjustment
with
the
new
government
was
unpromising
from
the
known
hostility
of
its
head
to
the
united
states
yet
determined
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
on
our
part
to
restore
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countries
our
minister
was
instructed
to
present
his
credentials
to
the
new
government
and
ask
to
be
accredited
by
it
in
the
diplomatic
character
in
which
he
had
been
commissioned
these
instructions
he
executed
by
his
note
of
the
st
of
march
addressed
to
the
mexican
minister
of
foreign
affairs
but
his
request
was
insultingly
refused
by
that
minister
in
his
answer
of
the
th
of
the
same
month
no
alternative
remained
for
our
minister
but
to
demand
his
passports
and
return
to
the
united
states
thus
was
the
extraordinary
spectacle
presented
to
the
civilized
world
of
a
government
in
violation
of
its
own
express
agreement
having
twice
rejected
a
minister
of
peace
invested
with
full
powers
to
adjust
all
the
existing
differences
between
the
two
countries
in
a
manner
just
and
honorable
to
both
i
am
not
aware
that
modern
history
presents
a
parallel
case
in
which
in
time
of
peace
one
nation
has
refused
even
to
hear
propositions
from
another
for
terminating
existing
difficulties
between
them
scarcely
a
hope
of
adjusting
our
difficulties
even
at
a
remote
day
or
of
preserving
peace
with
mexico
could
be
cherished
while
paredes
remained
at
the
head
of
the
government
he
had
acquired
the
supreme
power
by
a
military
revolution
and
upon
the
most
solemn
pledges
to
wage
war
against
the
united
states
and
to
reconquer
texas
which
he
claimed
as
a
revolted
province
of
mexico
he
had
denounced
as
guilty
of
treason
all
those
mexicans
who
considered
texas
as
no
longer
constituting
a
part
of
the
territory
of
mexico
and
who
were
friendly
to
the
cause
of
peace
the
duration
of
the
war
which
he
waged
against
the
united
states
was
indefinite
because
the
end
which
he
proposed
of
the
reconquest
of
texas
was
hopeless
besides
there
was
good
reason
to
believe
from
all
his
conduct
that
it
was
his
intention
to
convert
the
republic
of
mexico
into
a
monarchy
and
to
call
a
foreign
european
prince
to
the
throne
preparatory
to
this
end
he
had
during
his
short
rule
destroyed
the
liberty
of
the
press
tolerating
that
portion
of
it
only
which
openly
advocated
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
the
better
to
secure
the
success
of
his
ultimate
designs
he
had
by
an
arbitrary
decree
convoked
a
congress
not
to
be
elected
by
the
free
voice
of
the
people
but
to
be
chosen
in
a
manner
to
make
them
subservient
to
his
will
and
to
give
him
absolute
control
over
their
deliberations
under
all
these
circumstances
it
was
believed
that
any
revolution
in
mexico
founded
upon
opposition
to
the
ambitious
projects
of
paredes
would
tend
to
promote
the
cause
of
peace
as
well
as
prevent
any
attempted
european
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
north
american
continent
both
objects
of
deep
interest
to
the
united
states
any
such
foreign
interference
if
attempted
must
have
been
resisted
by
the
united
states
my
views
upon
that
subject
were
fully
communicated
to
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
in
any
event
it
was
certain
that
no
change
whatever
in
the
government
of
mexico
which
would
deprive
paredes
of
power
could
be
for
the
worse
so
far
as
the
united
states
were
concerned
while
it
was
highly
probable
that
any
change
must
be
for
the
better
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
existing
when
congress
on
the
th
of
may
last
recognized
the
existence
of
the
war
which
had
been
commenced
by
the
government
of
paredes
and
it
became
an
object
of
much
importance
with
a
view
to
a
speedy
settlement
of
our
difficulties
and
the
restoration
of
an
honorable
peace
that
paredes
should
not
retain
power
in
mexico
before
that
time
there
were
symptoms
of
a
revolution
in
mexico
favored
as
it
was
understood
to
be
by
the
more
liberal
party
and
especially
by
those
who
were
opposed
to
foreign
interference
and
to
the
monarchical
form
of
government
santa
anna
was
then
in
exile
in
havana
having
been
expelled
from
power
and
banished
from
his
country
by
a
revolution
which
occurred
in
december
but
it
was
known
that
he
had
still
a
considerable
party
in
his
favor
in
mexico
it
was
also
equally
well
known
that
no
vigilance
which
could
be
exerted
by
our
squadron
would
in
all
probability
have
prevented
him
from
effecting
a
landing
somewhere
on
the
extensive
gulf
coast
of
mexico
if
he
desired
to
return
to
his
country
he
had
openly
professed
an
entire
change
of
policy
had
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
subverted
the
federal
constitution
of
and
avowed
that
he
was
now
in
favor
of
its
restoration
he
had
publicly
declared
his
hostility
in
strongest
terms
to
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
and
to
european
interference
in
the
affairs
of
his
country
information
to
this
effect
had
been
received
from
sources
believed
to
be
reliable
at
the
date
of
the
recognition
of
the
existence
of
the
war
by
congress
and
was
afterwards
fully
confirmed
by
the
receipt
of
the
dispatch
of
our
consul
in
the
city
of
mexico
with
the
accompanying
documents
which
are
herewith
transmitted
besides
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
must
see
the
ruinous
consequences
to
mexico
of
a
war
with
the
united
states
and
that
it
would
be
his
interest
to
favor
peace
it
was
under
these
circumstances
and
upon
these
considerations
that
it
was
deemed
expedient
not
to
obstruct
his
return
to
mexico
should
he
attempt
to
do
so
our
object
was
the
restoration
of
peace
and
with
that
view
no
reason
was
perceived
why
we
should
take
part
with
paredes
and
aid
him
by
means
of
our
blockade
in
preventing
the
return
of
his
rival
to
mexico
on
the
contrary
it
was
believed
that
the
intestine
divisions
which
ordinary
sagacity
could
not
but
anticipate
as
the
fruit
of
santa
annas
return
to
mexico
and
his
contest
with
paredes
might
strongly
tend
to
produce
a
disposition
with
both
parties
to
restore
and
preserve
peace
with
the
united
states
paredes
was
a
soldier
by
profession
and
a
monarchist
in
principle
he
had
but
recently
before
been
successful
in
a
military
revolution
by
which
he
had
obtained
power
he
was
the
sworn
enemy
of
the
united
states
with
which
he
had
involved
his
country
in
the
existing
war
santa
anna
had
been
expelled
from
power
by
the
army
was
known
to
be
in
open
hostility
to
paredes
and
publicly
pledged
against
foreign
intervention
and
the
restoration
of
monarchy
in
mexico
in
view
of
these
facts
and
circumstances
it
was
that
when
orders
were
issued
to
the
commander
of
our
naval
forces
in
the
gulf
on
the
th
day
of
may
last
the
same
day
on
which
the
existence
of
the
war
was
recognized
by
congress
to
place
the

in

in
the

of

following
by
which
the

was
overthrown
and

has
since
been
banished
from

and
is
now
in
exile
shortly
afterwards
santa

returned
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
his
return
may
not
yet
prove
to
be
favorable
to
a
pacific
adjustment
of
the
existing
difficulties
it
being
manifestly
his
interest
not
to
persevere
in
the
prosecution
of
a
war
commenced
by
paredes
to
accomplish
a
purpose
so
absurd
as
the
reconquest
of
texas
to
the
sabine
had
paredes
remained
in
power
it
is
morally
certain
that
any
pacific
adjustment
would
have
been
hopeless
upon
the
commencement
of
hostilities
by
mexico
against
the
united
states
the
indignant
spirit
of
the
nation
was
at
once
aroused
congress
promptly
responded
to
the
expectations
of
the
country
and
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
may
last
recognized
the
fact
that
war
existed
by
the
act
of
mexico
between
the
united
states
and
that
republic
and
granted
the
means
necessary
for
its
vigorous
prosecution
being
involved
in
a
war
thus
commenced
by
mexico
and
for
the
justice
of
which
on
our
part
we
may
confidently
appeal
to
the
whole
world
i
resolved
to
prosecute
it
with
the
utmost
vigor
accordingly
the
ports
of
mexico
on
the
gulf
and
on
the
pacific
have
been
placed
under
blockade
and
her
territory
invaded
at
several
important
points
the
reports
from
the
departments
of
war
and
of
the
navy
will
inform
you
more
in
detail
of
the
measures
adopted
in
the
emergency
in
which
our
country
was
placed
and
of
the
gratifying
results
which
have
been
accomplished
the
various
columns
of
the
army
have
performed
their
duty
under
great
disadvantages
with
the
most
distinguished
skill
and
courage
the
victories
of
palo
alto
and
resaca
de
la
palma
and
of
monterey
won
against
greatly
superior
numbers
and
against
most
decided
advantages
in
other
respects
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
were
brilliant
in
their
execution
and
entitle
our
brave
officers
and
soldiers
to
the
grateful
thanks
of
their
country
the
nation
deplores
the
loss
of
the
brave
officers
and
men
who
have
gallantly
fallen
while
vindicating
and
defending
their
countrys
rights
and
honor
it
is
a
subject
of
pride
and
satisfaction
that
our
volunteer
citizen
soldiers
who
so
promptly
responded
to
their
countrys
call
with
an
experience
of
the
discipline
of
a
camp
of
only
a
few
weeks
have
borne
their
part
in
the
hardfought
battle
of
monterey
with
a
constancy
and
courage
equal
to
that
of
veteran
troops
and
worthy
of
the
highest
admiration
the
privations
of
long
marches
through
the
enemys
country
and
through
a
wilderness
have
been
borne
without
a
murmur
by
rapid
movements
the
province
of
new
mexico
with
santa
fe
its
capital
has
been
captured
without
bloodshed
the
navy
has
cooperated
with
the
army
and
rendered
important
services
if
not
so
brilliant
it
is
because
the
enemy
had
no
force
to
meet
them
on
their
own
element
and
because
of
the
defenses
which
nature
has
interposed
in
the
difficulties
of
the
navigation
on
the
mexican
coast
our
squadron
in
the
pacific
with
the
cooperation
of
a
gallant
officer
of
the
army
and
a
small
force
hastily
collected
in
that
distant
country
has
acquired
bloodless
possession
of
the
californias
and
the
american
flag
has
been
raised
at
every
important
point
in
that
province
i
congratulate
you
on
the
success
which
has
thus
attended
our
military
and
naval
operations
in
less
than
seven
months
after
mexico
commenced
hostilities
at
a
time
selected
by
herself
we
have
taken
possession
of
many
of
her
principal
ports
driven
back
and
pursued
her
invading
army
and
acquired
military
possession
of
the
mexican
provinces
of
new
mexico
new
leon
coahuila
tamaulipas
and
the
californias
a
territory
larger
in
extent
than
that
embraced
in
the
original
thirteen
states
of
the
union
inhabited
by
a
considerable
population
and
much
of
it
more
than
miles
from
the
points
at
which
we
had
to
collect
our
forces
and
commence
our
movements
by
the
blockade
the
import
and
export
trade
of
the
enemy
has
been
cut
off
well
may
the
american
people
be
proud
of
the
energy
and
gallantry
of
our
regular
and
volunteer
officers
and
soldiers
the
events
of
these
few
months
afford
a
gratifying
proof
that
our
country
can
under
any
emergency
confidently
rely
for
the
maintenance
of
her
honor
and
the
defense
of
her
rights
on
an
effective
force
ready
at
all
times
voluntarily
to
relinquish
the
comforts
of
home
for
the
perils
and
privations
of
the
camp
and
though
such
a
force
may
be
for
the
time
expensive
it
is
in
the
end
economical
as
the
ability
to
command
it
removes
the
necessity
of
employing
a
large
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
and
proves
that
our
people
love
their
institutions
and
are
ever
ready
to
defend
and
protect
them
while
the
war
was
in
a
course
of
vigorous
and
successful
prosecution
being
still
anxious
to
arrest
its
evils
and
considering
that
after
the
brilliant
victories
of
our
arms
on
the
th
and
th
of
may
last
the
national
honor
could
not
be
compromitted
by
it
another
overture
was
made
to
mexico
by
my
direction
on
the
th
of
july
last
to
terminate
hostilities
by
a
peace
just
and
honorable
to
both
countries
on
the
st
of
august
following
the
mexican
government
declined
to
accept
this
friendly
overture
but
referred
it
to
the
decision
of
a
mexican
congress
to
be
assembled
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
month
i
communicate
to
you
herewith
a
copy
of
the
letter
of
the
secretary
of
state
proposing
to
reopen
negotiations
of
the
answer
of
the
mexican
government
and
of
the
reply
thereto
of
the
secretary
of
state
the
war
will
continue
to
be
prosecuted
with
vigor
as
the
best
means
of
securing
peace
it
is
hoped
that
the
decision
of
the
mexican
congress
to
which
our
last
overture
has
been
referred
may
result
in
a
speedy
and
honorable
peace
with
our
experience
however
of
the
unreasonable
course
of
the
mexican
authorities
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
not
to
relax
in
the
energy
of
our
military
operations
until
the
result
is
made
known
in
this
view
it
is
deemed
important
to
hold
military
possession
of
all
the
provinces
which
have
been
taken
until
a
definitive
treaty
of
peace
shall
have
been
concluded
and
ratified
by
the
two
countries
the
war
has
not
been
waged
with
a
view
to
conquest
but
having
been
commenced
by
mexico
it
has
been
carried
into
the
enemys
country
and
will
be
vigorously
prosecuted
there
with
a
view
to
obtain
an
honorable
peace
and
thereby
secure
ample
indemnity
for
the
expenses
of
the
war
as
well
as
to
our
muchinjured
citizens
who
hold
large
pecuniary
demands
against
mexico
by
the
laws
of
nations
a
conquered
country
is
subject
to
be
governed
by
the
conqueror
during
his
military
possession
and
until
there
is
either
a
treaty
of
peace
or
he
shall
voluntarily
withdraw
from
it
the
old
civil
government
being
necessarily
superseded
it
is
the
right
and
duty
of
the
conqueror
to
secure
his
conquest
and
to
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
civil
order
and
the
rights
of
the
inhabitants
this
right
has
been
exercised
and
this
duty
performed
by
our
military
and
naval
commanders
by
the
establishment
of
temporary
governments
in
some
of
the
conquered
provinces
of
mexico
assimilating
them
as
far
as
practicable
to
the
free
institutions
of
our
own
country
in
the
provinces
of
new
mexico
and
of
the
californias
little
if
any
further
resistance
is
apprehended
from
the
inhabitants
to
the
temporary
governments
which
have
thus
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
and
according
to
the
laws
of
war
been
established
it
may
be
proper
to
provide
for
the
security
of
these
important
conquests
by
making
an
adequate
appropriation
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
fortifications
and
defraying
the
expenses
necessarily
incident
to
the
maintenance
of
our
possession
and
authority
over
them
near
the
close
of
your
last
session
for
reasons
communicated
to
congress
i
deemed
it
important
as
a
measure
for
securing
a
speedy
peace
with
mexico
that
a
sum
of
money
should
be
appropriated
and
placed
in
the
power
of
the
executive
similar
to
that
which
had
been
made
upon
two
former
occasions
during
the
administration
of
president
jefferson
on
the
th
of
february
an
appropriation
of
was
made
and
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
president
its
object
is
well
known
it
was
at
that
time
in
contemplation
to
acquire
louisiana
from
france
and
it
was
intended
to
be
applied
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
which
might
be
paid
for
that
territory
on
the
th
of
february
the
same
sum
was
in
like
manner
appropriated
with
a
view
to
the
purchase
of
the
floridas
from
spain
these
appropriations
were
made
to
facilitate
negotiations
and
as
a
means
to
enable
the
president
to
accomplish
the
important
objects
in
view
though
it
did
not
become
necessary
for
the
president
to
use
these
appropriations
yet
a
state
of
things
might
have
arisen
in
which
it
would
have
been
highly
important
for
him
to
do
so
and
the
wisdom
of
making
them
can
not
be
doubted
it
is
believed
that
the
measure
recommended
at
your
last
session
met
with
the
approbation
of
decided
majorities
in
both
houses
of
congress
indeed
in
different
forms
a
bill
making
an
appropriation
of
passed
each
house
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
it
did
not
become
a
law
the
reasons
which
induced
me
to
recommend
the
measure
at
that
time
still
exist
and
i
again
submit
the
subject
for
your
consideration
and
suggest
the
importance
of
early
action
upon
it
should
the
appropriation
be
made
and
be
not
needed
it
will
remain
in
the
treasury
should
it
be
deemed
proper
to
apply
it
in
whole
or
in
part
it
will
be
accounted
for
as
other
public
expenditures
immediately
after
congress
had
recognized
the
existence
of
the
war
with
mexico
my
attention
was
directed
to
the
danger
that
privateers
might
be
fitted
out
in
the
ports
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
to
prey
upon
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
i
invited
the
special
attention
of
the
spanish
government
to
the
fourteenth
article
of
our
treaty
with
that
power
of
the
th
of
october
under
which
the
citizens
and
subjects
of
either
nation
who
shall
take
commissions
or
letters
of
marque
to
act
as
privateers
against
the
other
shall
be
punished
as
pirates
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
i
have
received
assurances
from
the
spanish
government
that
this
article
of
the
treaty
shall
be
faithfully
observed
on
its
part
orders
for
this
purpose
were
immediately
transmitted
from
that
government
to
the
authorities
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
to
exert
their
utmost
vigilance
in
preventing
any
attempts
to
fit
out
privateers
in
those
islands
against
the
united
states
from
the
good
faith
of
spain
i
am
fully
satisfied
that
this
treaty
will
be
executed
in
its
spirit
as
well
as
its
letter
whilst
the
united
states
will
on
their
part
faithfully
perform
all
the
obligations
which
it
imposes
on
them
information
has
been
recently
received
at
the
department
of
state
that
the
mexican
government
has
sent
to
havana
blank
commissions
to
privateers
and
blank
certificates
of
naturalization
signed
by
general
salas
the
present
head
of
the
mexican
government
there
is
also
reason
to
apprehend
that
similar
documents
have
been
transmitted
to
other
parts
of
the
world
copies
of
these
papers
in
translation
are
herewith
transmitted
as
the
preliminaries
required
by
the
practice
of
civilized
nations
for
commissioning
privateers
and
regulating
their
conduct
appear
not
to
have
been
observed
and
as
these
commissions
are
in
blank
to
be
filled
up
with
the
names
of
citizens
and
subjects
of
all
nations
who
may
be
willing
to
purchase
them
the
whole
proceeding
can
only
be
construed
as
an
invitation
to
all
the
freebooters
upon
earth
who
are
willing
to
pay
for
the
privilege
to
cruise
against
american
commerce
it
will
be
for
our
courts
of
justice
to
decide
whether
under
such
circumstances
these
mexican
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
shall
protect
those
who
accept
them
and
commit
robberies
upon
the
high
seas
under
their
authority
from
the
pains
and
penalties
of
piracy
if
the
certificates
of
naturalization
thus
granted
be
intended
by
mexico
to
shield
spanish
subjects
from
the
guilt
and
punishment
of
pirates
under
our
treaty
with
spain
they
will
certainly
prove
unavailing
such
a
subterfuge
would
be
but
a
weak
device
to
defeat
the
provisions
of
a
solemn
treaty
i
recommend
that
congress
should
immediately
provide
by
law
for
the
trial
and
punishment
as
pirates
of
spanish
subjects
who
escaping
the
vigilance
of
their
government
shall
be
found
guilty
of
privateering
against
the
united
states
i
do
not
apprehend
serious
danger
from
these
privateers
our
navy
will
be
constantly
on
the
alert
to
protect
our
commerce
besides
in
case
prizes
should
be
made
of
american
vessels
the
utmost
vigilance
will
be
exerted
by
our
blockading
squadron
to
prevent
the
captors
from
taking
them
into
mexican
ports
and
it
is
not
apprehended
that
any
nation
will
violate
its
neutrality
by
suffering
such
prizes
to
be
condemned
and
sold
within
its
jurisdiction
i
recommend
that
congress
should
immediately
provide
by
law
for
granting
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
against
vessels
under
the
mexican
flag
it
is
true
that
there
are
but
few
if
any
commercial
vessels
of
mexico
upon
the
high
seas
and
it
is
therefore
not
probable
that
many
american
privateers
would
be
fitted
out
in
case
a
law
should
pass
authorizing
this
mode
of
warfare
it
is
notwithstanding
certain
that
such
privateers
may
render
good
service
to
the
commercial
interests
of
the
country
by
recapturing
our
merchant
ships
should
any
be
taken
by
armed
vessels
under
the
mexican
flag
as
well
as
by
capturing
these
vessels
themselves
every
means
within
our
power
should
be
rendered
available
for
the
protection
of
our
commerce
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
exhibit
a
detailed
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
finances
the
imports
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
exported
was
leaving
the
amount
retained
in
the
country
for
domestic
consumption
the
value
of
the
exports
for
the
same
period
was
of
which
consisted
of
domestic
productions
and
of
foreign
articles
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
same
year
were
of
which
there
was
derived
from
customs
from
the
sales
of
public
lands
and
from
incidental
and
miscellaneous
sources
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
and
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
day
of
july
last
was
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
including
treasury
notes
on
the
st
of
the
present
month
was
of
which
the
sum
of
was
outstanding
on
the
th
of
march
leaving
the
amount
incurred
since
that
time
in
order
to
prosecute
the
war
with
mexico
with
vigor
and
energy
as
the
best
means
of
bringing
it
to
a
speedy
and
honorable
termination
a
further
loan
will
be
necessary
to
meet
the
expenditures
for
the
present
and
the
next
fiscal
year
if
the
war
should
be
continued
until
the
th
of
june
being
the
end
of
the
next
fiscal
year
it
is
estimated
that
an
additional
loan
of
will
be
required
this
estimate
is
made
upon
the
assumption
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
retain
constantly
in
the
treasury
to
guard
against
contingencies
if
such
surplus
were
not
required
to
be
retained
then
a
loan
of
would
be
sufficient
if
however
congress
should
at
the
present
session
impose
a
revenue
duty
on
the
principal
articles
now
embraced
in
the
free
list
it
is
estimated
that
an
additional
annual
revenue
of
about
two
millions
and
a
half
amounting
it
is
estimated
on
the
th
of
june
to
would
be
derived
from
that
source
and
the
loan
required
would
be
reduced
by
that
amount
it
is
estimated
also
that
should
congress
graduate
and
reduce
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
been
long
in
the
market
the
additional
revenue
derived
from
that
source
would
be
annually
for
several
years
to
come
between
half
a
million
and
a
million
dollars
and
the
loan
required
may
be
reduced
by
that
amount
also
should
these
measures
be
adopted
the
loan
required
would
not
probably
exceed
or
leaving
in
the
treasury
a
constant
surplus
of
the
loan
proposed
it
is
estimated
will
be
sufficient
to
cover
the
necessary
expenditures
both
for
the
war
and
for
all
other
purposes
up
to
the
th
of
june
and
an
amount
of
this
loan
not
exceeding
onehalf
may
be
required
during
the
present
fiscal
year
and
the
greater
part
of
the
remainder
during
the
first
half
of
the
fiscal
year
succeeding
in
order
that
timely
notice
may
be
given
and
proper
measures
taken
to
effect
the
loan
or
such
portion
of
it
as
may
be
required
it
is
important
that
the
authority
of
congress
to
make
it
be
given
at
an
early
period
of
your
present
session
it
is
suggested
that
the
loan
should
be
contracted
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
with
authority
to
purchase
the
stock
and
pay
it
off
at
an
earlier
period
at
its
market
value
out
of
any
surplus
which
may
at
any
time
be
in
the
treasury
applicable
to
that
purpose
after
the
establishment
of
peace
with
mexico
it
is
supposed
that
a
considerable
surplus
will
exist
and
that
the
debt
may
be
extinguished
in
a
much
shorter
period
than
that
for
which
it
may
be
contracted
the
period
of
twenty
years
as
that
for
which
the
proposed
loan
may
be
contracted
in
preference
to
a
shorter
period
is
suggested
because
all
experience
both
at
home
and
abroad
has
shown
that
loans
are
effected
upon
much
better
terms
upon
long
time
than
when
they
are
reimbursable
at
short
dates
necessary
as
this
measure
is
to
sustain
the
honor
and
the
interests
of
the
country
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
it
is
not
doubted
but
that
congress
will
promptly
authorize
it
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
july
last
exceeded
notwithstanding
considerable
expenditures
had
been
made
for
the
war
during
the
months
of
may
and
june
preceding
but
for
the
war
the
whole
public
debt
could
and
would
have
been
extinguished
within
a
short
period
and
it
was
a
part
of
my
settled
policy
to
do
so
and
thus
relieve
the
people
from
its
burden
and
place
the
government
in
a
position
which
would
enable
it
to
reduce
the
public
expenditures
to
that
economical
standard
which
is
most
consistent
with
the
general
welfare
and
the
pure
and
wholesome
progress
of
our
institutions
among
our
just
causes
of
complaint
against
mexico
arising
out
of
her
refusal
to
treat
for
peace
as
well
before
as
since
the
war
so
unjustly
commenced
on
her
part
are
the
extraordinary
expenditures
in
which
we
have
been
involved
justice
to
our
own
people
will
make
it
proper
that
mexico
should
be
held
responsible
for
these
expenditures
economy
in
the
public
expenditures
is
at
all
times
a
high
duty
which
all
public
functionaries
of
the
government
owe
to
the
people
this
duty
becomes
the
more
imperative
in
a
period
of
war
when
large
and
extraordinary
expenditures
become
unavoidable
during
the
existence
of
the
war
with
mexico
all
our
resources
should
be
husbanded
and
no
appropriations
made
except
such
as
are
absolutely
necessary
for
its
vigorous
prosecution
and
the
due
administration
of
the
government
objects
of
appropriation
which
in
peace
may
be
deemed
useful
or
proper
but
which
are
not
indispensable
for
the
public
service
may
when
the
country
is
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
be
well
postponed
to
a
future
period
by
the
observance
of
this
policy
at
your
present
session
large
amounts
may
be
saved
to
the
treasury
and
be
applied
to
objects
of
pressing
and
urgent
necessity
and
thus
the
creation
of
a
corresponding
amount
of
public
debt
may
be
avoided
it
is
not
meant
to
recommend
that
the
ordinary
and
necessary
appropriations
for
the
support
of
government
should
be
withheld
but
it
is
well
known
that
at
every
session
of
congress
appropriations
are
proposed
for
numerous
objects
which
may
or
may
not
be
made
without
materially
affecting
the
public
interests
and
these
it
is
recommended
should
not
be
granted
the
act
passed
at
your
last
session
reducing
the
duties
on
imports
not
having
gone
into
operation
until
the
st
of
the
present
month
there
has
not
been
time
for
its
practical
effect
upon
the
revenue
and
the
business
of
the
country
to
be
developed
it
is
not
doubted
however
that
the
just
policy
which
it
adopts
will
add
largely
to
our
foreign
trade
and
promote
the
general
prosperity
although
it
can
not
be
certainly
foreseen
what
amount
of
revenue
it
will
yield
it
is
estimated
that
it
will
exceed
that
produced
by
the
act
of
which
it
superseded
the
leading
principles
established
by
it
are
to
levy
the
taxes
with
a
view
to
raise
revenue
and
to
impose
them
upon
the
articles
imported
according
to
their
actual
value
the
act
of
by
the
excessive
rates
of
duty
which
it
imposed
on
many
articles
either
totally
excluded
them
from
importation
or
greatly
reduced
the
amount
imported
and
thus
diminished
instead
of
producing
revenue
by
it
the
taxes
were
imposed
not
for
the
legitimate
purpose
of
raising
revenue
but
to
afford
advantages
to
favored
classes
at
the
expense
of
a
large
majority
of
their
fellowcitizens
those
employed
in
agriculture
mechanical
pursuits
commerce
and
navigation
were
compelled
to
contribute
from
their
substance
to
swell
the
profits
and
overgrown
wealth
of
the
comparatively
few
who
had
invested
their
capital
in
manufactures
the
taxes
were
not
levied
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
the
articles
upon
which
they
were
imposed
but
widely
departing
from
this
just
rule
the
lighter
taxes
were
in
many
cases
levied
upon
articles
of
luxury
and
high
price
and
the
heavier
taxes
on
those
of
necessity
and
low
price
consumed
by
the
great
mass
of
the
people
it
was
a
system
the
inevitable
effect
of
which
was
to
relieve
favored
classes
and
the
wealthy
few
from
contributing
their
just
proportion
for
the
support
of
government
and
to
lay
the
burden
on
the
labor
of
the
many
engaged
in
other
pursuits
than
manufactures
a
system
so
unequal
and
unjust
has
been
superseded
by
the
existing
law
which
imposes
duties
not
for
the
benefit
or
injury
of
classes
or
pursuits
but
distributes
and
as
far
as
practicable
equalizes
the
public
burdens
among
all
classes
and
occupations
the
favored
classes
who
under
the
unequal
and
unjust
system
which
has
been
repealed
have
heretofore
realized
large
profits
and
many
of
them
amassed
large
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
the
many
who
have
been
made
tributary
to
them
will
have
no
reason
to
complain
if
they
shall
be
required
to
bear
their
just
proportion
of
the
taxes
necessary
for
the
support
of
government
so
far
from
it
it
will
be
perceived
by
an
examination
of
the
existing
law
that
discriminations
in
the
rates
of
duty
imposed
within
the
revenue
principle
have
been
retained
in
their
favor
the
incidental
aid
against
foreign
competition
which
they
still
enjoy
gives
them
an
advantage
which
no
other
pursuits
possess
but
of
this
none
others
will
complain
because
the
duties
levied
are
necessary
for
revenue
these
revenue
duties
including
freights
and
charges
which
the
importer
must
pay
before
he
can
come
in
competition
with
the
home
manufacturer
in
our
markets
amount
on
nearly
all
our
leading
branches
of
manufacture
to
more
than
onethird
of
the
value
of
the
imported
article
and
in
some
cases
to
almost
onehalf
its
value
with
such
advantages
it
is
not
doubted
that
our
domestic
manufacturers
will
continue
to
prosper
realizing
in
wellconducted
establishments
even
greater
profits
than
can
be
derived
from
any
other
regular
business
indeed
so
far
from
requiring
the
protection
of
even
incidental
revenue
duties
our
manufacturers
in
several
leading
branches
are
extending
their
business
giving
evidence
of
great
ingenuity
and
skill
and
of
their
ability
to
compete
with
increased
prospect
of
success
for
the
open
market
of
the
world
domestic
manufactures
to
the
value
of
several
millions
of
dollars
which
can
not
find
a
market
at
home
are
annually
exported
to
foreign
countries
with
such
rates
of
duty
as
those
established
by
the
existing
law
the
system
will
probably
be
permanent
and
capitalists
who
are
made
or
shall
hereafter
make
their
investments
in
manufactures
will
know
upon
what
to
rely
the
country
will
be
satisfied
with
these
rates
because
the
advantages
which
the
manufacturers
still
enjoy
result
necessarily
from
the
collection
of
revenue
for
the
support
of
government
high
protective
duties
from
their
unjust
operation
upon
the
masses
of
the
people
can
not
fail
to
give
rise
to
extensive
dissatisfaction
and
complaint
and
to
constant
efforts
to
change
or
repeal
them
rendering
all
investments
in
manufactures
uncertain
and
precarious
lower
and
more
permanent
rates
of
duty
at
the
same
time
that
they
will
yield
to
the
manufacturer
fair
and
remunerating
profits
will
secure
him
against
the
danger
of
frequent
changes
in
the
system
which
can
not
fail
to
ruinously
affect
his
interests
simultaneously
with
the
relaxation
of
the
restrictive
policy
by
the
united
states
great
britain
from
whose
example
we
derived
the
system
has
relaxed
hers
she
has
modified
her
corn
laws
and
reduced
many
other
duties
to
moderate
revenue
rates
after
ages
of
experience
the
statesmen
of
that
country
have
been
constrained
by
a
stern
necessity
and
by
a
public
opinion
having
its
deep
foundation
in
the
sufferings
and
wants
of
impoverished
millions
to
abandon
a
system
the
effect
of
which
was
to
build
up
immense
fortunes
in
the
hands
of
the
few
and
to
reduce
the
laboring
millions
to
pauperism
and
misery
nearly
in
the
same
ratio
that
labor
was
depressed
capital
was
increased
and
concentrated
by
the
british
protective
policy
the
evils
of
the
system
in
great
britain
were
at
length
rendered
intolerable
and
it
has
been
abandoned
but
not
without
a
severe
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
protected
and
favored
classes
to
retain
the
unjust
advantages
which
they
have
so
long
enjoyed
it
was
to
be
expected
that
a
similar
struggle
would
be
made
by
the
same
classes
in
the
united
states
whenever
an
attempt
was
made
to
modify
or
abolish
the
same
unjust
system
here
the
protective
policy
had
been
in
operation
in
the
united
states
for
a
much
shorter
period
and
its
pernicious
effects
were
not
therefore
so
clearly
perceived
and
felt
enough
however
was
known
of
these
effects
to
induce
its
repeal
it
would
be
strange
if
in
the
face
of
the
example
of
great
britain
our
principal
foreign
customer
and
of
the
evils
of
a
system
rendered
manifest
in
that
country
by
long
and
painful
experience
and
in
the
face
of
the
immense
advantages
which
under
a
more
liberal
commercial
policy
we
are
already
deriving
and
must
continue
to
derive
by
supplying
her
starving
population
with
food
the
united
states
should
restore
a
policy
which
she
has
been
compelled
to
abandon
and
thus
diminish
her
ability
to
purchase
from
us
the
food
and
other
articles
which
she
so
much
needs
and
we
so
much
desire
to
sell
by
the
simultaneous
abandonment
of
the
protective
policy
by
great
britain
and
the
united
states
new
and
important
markets
have
already
been
opened
for
our
agricultural
and
other
products
commerce
and
navigation
have
received
a
new
impulse
labor
and
trade
have
been
released
from
the
artificial
trammels
which
have
so
long
fettered
them
and
to
a
great
extent
reciprocity
in
the
exchange
of
commodities
has
been
introduced
at
the
same
time
by
both
countries
and
greatly
for
the
benefit
of
both
great
britain
has
been
forced
by
the
pressure
of
circumstances
at
home
to
abandon
a
policy
which
has
been
upheld
for
ages
and
to
open
her
markets
for
our
immense
surplus
of
breadstuffs
and
it
is
confidently
believed
that
other
powers
of
europe
will
ultimately
see
the
wisdom
if
they
be
not
compelled
by
the
pauperism
and
sufferings
of
their
crowded
population
to
pursue
a
similar
policy
our
farmers
are
more
deeply
interested
in
maintaining
the
just
and
liberal
policy
of
the
existing
law
than
any
other
class
of
our
citizens
they
constitute
a
large
majority
of
our
population
and
it
is
well
known
that
when
they
prosper
all
other
pursuits
prosper
also
they
have
heretofore
not
only
received
none
of
the
bounties
or
favors
of
government
but
by
the
unequal
operations
of
the
protective
policy
have
been
made
by
the
burdens
of
taxation
which
it
imposed
to
contribute
to
the
bounties
which
have
enriched
others
when
a
foreign
as
well
as
a
home
market
is
opened
to
them
they
must
receive
as
they
are
now
receiving
increased
prices
for
their
products
they
will
find
a
readier
sale
and
at
better
prices
for
their
wheat
flour
rice
indian
corn
beef
pork
lard
butter
cheese
and
other
articles
which
they
produce
the
home
market
alone
is
inadequate
to
enable
them
to
dispose
of
the
immense
surplus
of
food
and
other
articles
which
they
are
capable
of
producing
even
at
the
most
reduced
prices
for
the
manifest
reason
that
they
can
not
be
consumed
in
the
country
the
united
states
can
from
their
immense
surplus
supply
not
only
the
home
demand
but
the
deficiencies
of
food
required
by
the
whole
world
that
the
reduced
production
of
some
of
the
chief
articles
of
food
in
great
britain
and
other
parts
of
europe
may
have
contributed
to
increase
the
demand
for
our
breadstuffs
and
provisions
is
not
doubted
but
that
the
great
and
efficient
cause
of
this
increased
demand
and
of
increased
prices
consists
in
the
removal
of
artificial
restrictions
heretofore
imposed
is
deemed
to
be
equally
certain
that
our
exports
of
food
already
increased
and
increasing
beyond
former
example
under
the
more
liberal
policy
which
has
been
adopted
will
be
still
vastly
enlarged
unless
they
be
checked
or
prevented
by
a
restoration
of
the
protective
policy
can
not
be
doubted
that
our
commercial
and
navigating
interests
will
be
enlarged
in
a
corresponding
ratio
with
the
increase
of
our
trade
is
equally
certain
while
our
manufacturing
interests
will
still
be
the
favored
interests
of
the
country
and
receive
the
incidental
protection
afforded
them
by
revenue
duties
and
more
than
this
they
can
not
justly
demand
in
my
annual
message
of
december
last
a
tariff
of
revenue
duties
based
upon
the
principles
of
the
existing
law
was
recommended
and
i
have
seen
no
reason
to
change
the
opinions
then
expressed
in
view
of
the
probable
beneficial
effects
of
that
law
i
recommend
that
the
policy
established
by
it
be
maintained
it
has
but
just
commenced
to
operate
and
to
abandon
or
modify
it
without
giving
it
a
fair
trial
would
be
inexpedient
and
unwise
should
defects
in
any
of
its
details
be
ascertained
by
actual
experience
to
exist
these
may
be
hereafter
corrected
but
until
such
defects
shall
become
manifest
the
act
should
be
fairly
tested
it
is
submitted
for
your
consideration
whether
it
may
not
be
proper
as
a
war
measure
to
impose
revenue
duties
on
some
of
the
articles
now
embraced
in
the
free
list
should
it
be
deemed
proper
to
impose
such
duties
with
a
view
to
raise
revenue
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
war
with
mexico
or
to
avoid
to
that
extent
the
creation
of
a
public
debt
they
may
be
repealed
when
the
emergency
which
gave
rise
to
them
shall
cease
to
exist
and
constitute
no
part
of
the
permanent
policy
of
the
country
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
last
to
provide
for
the
better
organization
of
the
treasury
and
for
the
collection
safekeeping
transfer
and
disbursement
of
the
public
revenue
has
been
carried
into
execution
as
rapidly
as
the
delay
necessarily
arising
out
of
the
appointment
of
new
officers
taking
and
approving
their
bonds
and
preparing
and
securing
proper
places
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
money
would
permit
it
is
not
proposed
to
depart
in
any
respect
from
the
principles
or
policy
on
which
this
great
measure
is
rounded
there
are
however
defects
in
the
details
of
the
measure
developed
by
its
practical
operation
which
are
fully
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
which
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
these
defects
would
impair
to
some
extent
the
successful
operation
of
the
law
at
all
times
but
are
especially
embarrassing
when
the
country
is
engaged
in
a
war
when
the
expenditures
are
greatly
increased
when
loans
are
to
be
effected
and
the
disbursements
are
to
be
made
at
points
many
hundred
miles
distant
in
some
cases
from
any
depository
and
a
large
portion
of
them
in
a
foreign
country
the
modifications
suggested
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
are
recommended
to
your
favorable
consideration
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
importance
of
establishing
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
at
new
york
twothirds
of
the
revenue
derived
from
customs
being
collected
at
that
point
the
demand
for
specie
to
pay
the
duties
will
be
large
and
a
branch
mint
where
foreign
coin
and
bullion
could
be
immediately
converted
into
american
coin
would
greatly
facilitate
the
transaction
of
the
public
business
enlarge
the
circulation
of
gold
and
silver
and
be
at
the
same
time
a
safe
depository
of
the
public
money
the
importance
of
graduating
and
reducing
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
been
long
offered
in
the
market
at
the
minimum
rate
authorized
by
existing
laws
and
remain
unsold
induces
me
again
to
recommend
the
subject
to
your
favorable
consideration
many
millions
of
acres
of
these
lands
have
been
offered
in
the
market
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
larger
quantities
for
more
than
ten
or
twenty
years
and
being
of
an
inferior
quality
they
must
remain
unsalable
for
an
indefinite
period
unless
the
price
at
which
they
may
be
purchased
shall
be
reduced
to
place
a
price
upon
them
above
their
real
value
is
not
only
to
prevent
their
sale
and
thereby
deprive
the
treasury
of
any
income
from
that
source
but
is
unjust
to
the
states
in
which
they
lie
because
it
retards
their
growth
and
increase
of
population
and
because
they
have
no
power
to
levy
a
tax
upon
them
as
upon
other
lands
within
their
limits
held
by
other
proprietors
than
the
united
states
for
the
support
of
their
local
governments
the
beneficial
effects
of
the
graduation
principle
have
been
realized
by
some
of
the
states
owning
the
lands
within
their
limits
in
which
it
has
been
adopted
they
have
been
demonstrated
also
by
the
united
states
acting
as
the
trustee
of
the
chickasaw
tribe
of
indians
in
the
sale
of
their
lands
lying
within
the
states
of
mississippi
and
alabama
the
chickasaw
lands
which
would
not
command
in
the
market
the
minimum
price
established
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
for
the
sale
of
their
lands
were
in
pursuance
of
the
treaty
of
with
that
tribe
subsequently
offered
for
sale
at
graduated
and
reduced
rates
for
limited
periods
the
result
was
that
large
quantities
of
these
lands
were
purchased
which
would
otherwise
have
remained
unsold
the
lands
were
disposed
of
at
their
real
value
and
many
persons
of
limited
means
were
enabled
to
purchase
small
tracts
upon
which
they
have
settled
with
their
families
that
similar
results
would
be
produced
by
the
adoption
of
the
graduation
policy
by
the
united
states
in
all
the
states
in
which
they
are
the
owners
of
large
bodies
of
lands
which
have
been
long
in
the
market
can
not
be
doubted
it
can
not
be
a
sound
policy
to
withhold
large
quantities
of
the
public
lands
from
the
use
and
occupation
of
our
citizens
by
fixing
upon
them
prices
which
experience
has
shown
they
will
not
command
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
wise
policy
to
afford
facilities
to
our
citizens
to
become
the
owners
at
low
and
moderate
rates
of
freeholds
of
their
own
instead
of
being
the
tenants
and
dependents
of
others
if
it
be
apprehended
that
these
lands
if
reduced
in
price
would
be
secured
in
large
quantities
by
speculators
or
capitalists
the
sales
may
be
restricted
in
limited
quantities
to
actual
settlers
or
persons
purchasing
for
purposes
of
cultivation
in
my
last
annual
message
i
submitted
for
the
consideration
of
congress
the
present
system
of
managing
the
mineral
lands
of
the
united
states
and
recommended
that
they
should
be
brought
into
market
and
sold
upon
such
terms
and
under
such
restrictions
as
congress
might
prescribe
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
last
the
reserved
lead
mines
and
contiguous
lands
in
the
states
of
illinois
and
arkansas
and
territories
of
wisconsin
and
iowa
were
authorized
to
be
sold
the
act
is
confined
in
its
operation
to
lead
mines
and
contiguous
lands
a
large
portion
of
the
public
lands
containing
copper
and
other
ores
is
represented
to
be
very
valuable
and
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
authorizing
the
sale
of
these
lands
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
from
their
supposed
value
may
in
the
judgment
of
congress
be
deemed
advisable
having
due
regard
to
the
interests
of
such
of
our
citizens
as
may
be
located
upon
them
it
will
be
important
during
your
present
session
to
establish
a
territorial
government
and
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
and
laws
of
the
united
states
over
the
territory
of
oregon
our
laws
regulating
trade
and
intercourse
with
the
indian
tribes
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
should
be
extended
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
for
the
purpose
of
executing
them
and
preserving
friendly
relations
with
the
indian
tribes
within
our
limits
an
additional
number
of
indian
agencies
will
be
required
and
should
be
authorized
by
law
the
establishment
of
customhouses
and
of
postoffices
and
postroads
and
provision
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
on
such
routes
as
the
public
convenience
will
suggest
require
legislative
authority
it
will
be
proper
also
to
establish
a
surveyorgenerals
office
in
that
territory
and
to
make
the
necessary
provision
for
surveying
the
public
lands
and
bringing
them
into
market
as
our
citizens
who
now
reside
in
that
distant
region
have
been
subjected
to
many
hardships
privations
and
sacrifices
in
their
emigration
and
by
their
improvements
have
enhanced
the
value
of
the
public
lands
in
the
neighborhood
of
their
settlements
it
is
recommended
that
liberal
grants
be
made
to
them
of
such
portions
of
these
lands
as
they
may
occupy
and
that
similar
grants
or
rights
of
preemption
be
made
to
all
who
may
emigrate
thither
within
a
limited
period
prescribed
by
law
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
contains
detailed
information
relative
to
the
several
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
with
that
department
the
operations
of
the
army
have
been
of
a
satisfactory
and
highly
gratifying
character
i
recommend
to
your
early
and
favorable
consideration
the
measures
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
war
for
speedily
filling
up
the
rank
and
file
of
the
regular
army
for
its
greater
efficiency
in
the
field
and
for
raising
an
additional
force
to
serve
during
the
war
with
mexico
embarrassment
is
likely
to
arise
for
want
of
legal
provision
authorizing
compensation
to
be
made
to
the
agents
employed
in
the
several
states
and
territories
to
pay
the
revolutionary
and
other
pensioners
the
amounts
allowed
them
by
law
your
attention
is
invited
to
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
war
on
this
subject
these
agents
incur
heavy
responsibilities
and
perform
important
duties
and
no
reason
exists
why
they
should
not
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
as
to
compensation
with
other
disbursing
officers
our
relations
with
the
various
indian
tribes
continue
to
be
of
a
pacific
character
the
unhappy
dissensions
which
have
existed
among
the
cherokees
for
many
years
past
have
been
healed
since
my
last
annual
message
important
treaties
have
been
negotiated
with
some
of
the
tribes
by
which
the
indian
title
to
large
tracts
of
valuable
land
within
the
limits
of
the
states
and
territories
has
been
extinguished
and
arrangements
made
for
removing
them
to
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
between
and
of
different
tribes
have
been
removed
to
the
country
provided
for
them
by
treaty
stipulations
and
arrangements
have
been
made
for
others
to
follow
in
our
intercourse
with
the
several
tribes
particular
attention
has
been
given
to
the
important
subject
of
education
the
number
of
schools
established
among
them
has
been
increased
and
additional
means
provided
not
only
for
teaching
them
the
rudiments
of
education
but
of
instructing
them
in
agriculture
and
the
mechanic
arts
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
a
satisfactory
view
of
the
operations
of
the
department
under
his
charge
during
the
past
year
it
is
gratifying
to
perceive
that
while
the
war
with
mexico
has
rendered
it
necessary
to
employ
an
unusual
number
of
our
armed
vessels
on
her
coasts
the
protection
due
to
our
commerce
in
other
quarters
of
the
world
has
not
proved
insufficient
no
means
will
be
spared
to
give
efficiency
to
the
naval
service
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
and
i
am
happy
to
know
that
the
officers
and
men
anxiously
desire
to
devote
themselves
to
the
service
of
their
country
in
any
enterprise
however
difficult
of
execution
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
proposition
to
add
to
each
of
our
foreign
squadrons
an
efficient
sea
steamer
and
as
especially
demanding
attention
the
establishment
at
pensacola
of
the
necessary
means
of
repairing
and
refitting
the
vessels
of
the
navy
employed
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
there
are
other
suggestions
in
the
report
which
deserve
and
i
doubt
not
will
receive
your
consideration
the
progress
and
condition
of
the
mail
service
for
the
past
year
are
fully
presented
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
revenue
for
the
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
amounted
to
which
is
less
than
that
of
the
preceding
year
the
payments
for
that
department
during
the
same
time
amounted
to
of
this
sum
have
been
drawn
from
the
treasury
the
disbursements
for
the
year
were
less
than
those
of
the
preceding
year
while
the
disbursements
have
been
thus
diminished
the
mail
facilities
have
been
enlarged
by
new
mail
routes
of
miles
an
increase
of
transportation
of
miles
and
the
establishment
of
new
postoffices
contractors
postmasters
and
others
engaged
in
this
branch
of
the
service
have
performed
their
duties
with
energy
and
faithfulness
deserving
commendation
for
many
interesting
details
connected
with
the
operations
of
this
establishment
you
are
referred
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
and
his
suggestions
for
improving
its
revenues
are
recommended
to
your
favorable
consideration
i
repeat
the
opinion
expressed
in
my
last
annual
message
that
the
business
of
this
department
should
be
so
regulated
that
the
revenues
derived
from
it
should
be
made
to
equal
the
expenditures
and
it
is
believed
that
this
may
be
done
by
proper
modifications
of
the
present
laws
as
suggested
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
without
changing
the
present
rates
of
postage
with
full
reliance
upon
the
wisdom
and
patriotism
of
your
deliberations
it
will
be
my
duty
as
it
will
be
my
anxious
desire
to
cooperate
with
you
in
every
constitutional
effort
to
promote
the
welfare
and
maintain
the
honor
of
our
common
country
