fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
under
the
benignant
providence
of
almighty
god
the
representatives
of
the
states
and
of
the
people
are
again
brought
together
to
deliberate
for
the
public
good
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
to
the
sovereign
arbiter
of
all
human
events
should
be
commensurate
with
the
boundless
blessings
which
we
enjoy
peace
plenty
and
contentment
reign
throughout
our
borders
and
our
beloved
country
presents
a
sublime
moral
spectacle
to
the
world
the
troubled
and
unsettled
condition
of
some
of
the
principal
european
powers
has
had
a
necessary
tendency
to
check
and
embarrass
trade
and
to
depress
prices
throughout
all
commercial
nations
but
notwithstanding
these
causes
the
united
states
with
their
abundant
products
have
felt
their
effects
less
severely
than
any
other
country
and
all
our
great
interests
are
still
prosperous
and
successful
in
reviewing
the
great
events
of
the
past
year
and
contrasting
the
agitated
and
disturbed
state
of
other
countries
with
our
own
tranquil
and
happy
condition
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
that
we
are
the
most
favored
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
while
the
people
of
other
countries
are
struggling
to
establish
free
institutions
under
which
man
may
govern
himself
we
are
in
the
actual
enjoyment
of
thema
rich
inheritance
from
our
fathers
while
enlightened
nations
of
europe
are
convulsed
and
distracted
by
civil
war
or
intestine
strife
we
settle
all
our
political
controversies
by
the
peaceful
exercise
of
the
rights
of
freemen
at
the
ballot
box
the
great
republican
maxim
so
deeply
engraven
on
the
hearts
of
our
people
that
the
will
of
the
majority
constitutionally
expressed
shall
prevail
is
our
sure
safeguard
against
force
and
violence
it
is
a
subject
of
just
pride
that
our
fame
and
character
as
a
nation
continue
rapidly
to
advance
in
the
estimation
of
the
civilized
world
to
our
wise
and
free
institutions
it
is
to
be
attributed
that
while
other
nations
have
achieved
glory
at
the
price
of
the
suffering
distress
and
impoverishment
of
their
people
we
have
won
our
honorable
position
in
the
midst
of
an
uninterrupted
prosperity
and
of
an
increasing
individual
comfort
and
happiness
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
our
relations
with
all
nations
are
friendly
and
pacific
advantageous
treaties
of
commerce
have
been
concluded
within
the
last
four
years
with
new
granada
peru
the
two
sicilies
belgium
hanover
oldenburg
and
mecklenburgschwerin
pursuing
our
example
the
restrictive
system
of
great
britain
our
principal
foreign
customer
has
been
relaxed
a
more
liberal
commercial
policy
has
been
adopted
by
other
enlightened
nations
and
our
trade
has
been
greatly
enlarged
and
extended
our
country
stands
higher
in
the
respect
of
the
world
than
at
any
former
period
to
continue
to
occupy
this
proud
position
it
is
only
necessary
to
preserve
peace
and
faithfully
adhere
to
the
great
and
fundamental
principle
of
our
foreign
policy
of
noninterference
in
the
domestic
concerns
of
other
nations
we
recognize
in
all
nations
the
right
which
we
enjoy
ourselves
to
change
and
reform
their
political
institutions
according
to
their
own
will
and
pleasure
hence
we
do
not
look
behind
existing
governments
capable
of
maintaining
their
own
authority
we
recognize
all
such
actual
governments
not
only
from
the
dictates
of
true
policy
but
from
a
sacred
regard
for
the
independence
of
nations
while
this
is
our
settled
policy
it
does
not
follow
that
we
can
ever
be
indifferent
spectators
of
the
progress
of
liberal
principles
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
hailed
with
enthusiasm
and
delight
the
establishment
of
the
french
republic
as
we
now
hail
the
efforts
in
progress
to
unite
the
states
of
germany
in
a
confederation
similar
in
many
respects
to
our
own
federal
union
if
the
great
and
enlightened
german
states
occupying
as
they
do
a
central
and
commanding
position
in
europe
shall
succeed
in
establishing
such
a
confederated
government
securing
at
the
same
time
to
the
citizens
of
each
state
local
governments
adapted
to
the
peculiar
condition
of
each
with
unrestricted
trade
and
intercourse
with
each
other
it
will
be
an
important
era
in
the
history
of
human
events
whilst
it
will
consolidate
and
strengthen
the
power
of
germany
it
must
essentially
promote
the
cause
of
peace
commerce
civilization
and
constitutional
liberty
throughout
the
world
with
all
the
governments
on
this
continent
our
relations
it
is
believed
are
now
on
a
more
friendly
and
satisfactory
footing
than
they
have
ever
been
at
any
former
period
since
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
our
intercourse
with
the
government
of
that
republic
has
been
of
the
most
friendly
character
the
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
states
to
mexico
has
been
received
and
accredited
and
a
diplomatic
representative
from
mexico
of
similar
rank
has
been
received
and
accredited
by
this
government
the
amicable
relations
between
the
two
countries
which
had
been
suspended
have
been
happily
restored
and
are
destined
i
trust
to
be
long
preserved
the
two
republics
both
situated
on
this
continent
and
with
coterminous
territories
have
every
motive
of
sympathy
and
of
interest
to
bind
them
together
in
perpetual
amity
this
gratifying
condition
of
our
foreign
relations
renders
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
call
your
attention
more
specifically
to
them
it
has
been
my
constant
aim
and
desire
to
cultivate
peace
and
commerce
with
all
nations
tranquility
at
home
and
peaceful
relations
abroad
constitute
the
true
permanent
policy
of
our
country
war
the
scourge
of
nations
sometimes
becomes
inevitable
but
is
always
to
be
avoided
when
it
can
be
done
consistently
with
the
rights
and
honor
of
a
nation
one
of
the
most
important
results
of
the
war
into
which
we
were
recently
forced
with
a
neighboring
nation
is
the
demonstration
it
has
afforded
of
the
military
strength
of
our
country
before
the
late
war
with
mexico
european
and
other
foreign
powers
entertained
imperfect
and
erroneous
views
of
our
physical
strength
as
a
nation
and
of
our
ability
to
prosecute
war
and
especially
a
war
waged
out
of
out
own
country
they
saw
that
our
standing
army
on
the
peace
establishment
did
not
exceed
men
accustomed
themselves
to
maintain
in
peace
large
standing
armies
for
the
protection
of
thrones
against
their
own
subjects
as
well
as
against
foreign
enemies
they
had
not
conceived
that
it
was
possible
for
a
nation
without
such
an
army
well
disciplined
and
of
long
service
to
wage
war
successfully
they
held
in
low
repute
our
militia
and
were
far
from
regarding
them
as
an
effective
force
unless
it
might
be
for
temporary
defensive
operations
when
invaded
on
our
own
soil
the
events
of
the
late
war
with
mexico
have
not
only
undeceived
them
but
have
removed
erroneous
impressions
which
prevailed
to
some
extent
even
among
a
portion
of
our
own
countrymen
that
war
has
demonstrated
that
upon
the
breaking
out
of
hostilities
not
anticipated
and
for
which
no
previous
preparation
had
been
made
a
volunteer
army
of
citizen
soldiers
equal
to
veteran
troops
and
in
numbers
equal
to
any
emergency
can
in
a
short
period
be
brought
into
the
field
unlike
what
would
have
occurred
in
any
other
country
we
were
under
no
necessity
of
resorting
to
drafts
or
conscriptions
on
the
contrary
such
was
the
number
of
volunteers
who
patriotically
tendered
their
services
that
the
chief
difficulty
was
in
making
selections
and
determining
who
should
be
disappointed
and
compelled
to
remain
at
home
our
citizen
soldiers
are
unlike
those
drawn
from
the
population
of
any
other
country
they
are
composed
indiscriminately
of
all
professions
and
pursuitsof
farmers
lawyers
physicians
merchants
manufacturers
mechanics
and
laborersand
this
not
only
among
the
officers
but
the
private
soldiers
in
the
ranks
our
citizen
soldiers
are
unlike
those
of
any
other
country
in
other
respects
they
are
armed
and
have
been
accustomed
from
their
youth
up
to
handle
and
use
firearms
and
a
large
proportion
of
them
especially
in
the
western
and
more
newly
settled
states
are
expert
marksmen
they
are
men
who
have
a
reputation
to
maintain
at
home
by
their
good
conduct
in
the
field
they
are
intelligent
and
there
is
an
individuality
of
character
which
is
found
in
the
ranks
of
no
other
army
in
battle
each
private
man
as
well
as
every
officer
rights
not
only
for
his
country
but
for
glory
and
distinction
among
his
fellowcitizens
when
he
shall
return
to
civil
life
the
war
with
mexico
has
demonstrated
not
only
the
ability
of
the
government
to
organize
a
numerous
army
upon
a
sudden
call
but
also
to
provide
it
with
all
the
munitions
and
necessary
supplies
with
dispatch
convenience
and
ease
and
to
direct
its
operations
with
efficiency
the
strength
of
our
institutions
has
not
only
been
displayed
in
the
valor
and
skill
of
our
troops
engaged
in
active
service
in
the
field
but
in
the
organization
of
those
executive
branches
which
were
charged
with
the
general
direction
and
conduct
of
the
war
while
too
great
praise
can
not
be
bestowed
upon
the
officers
and
men
who
fought
our
battles
it
would
be
unjust
to
withhold
from
those
officers
necessarily
stationed
at
home
who
were
charged
with
the
duty
of
furnishing
the
army
in
proper
time
and
at
proper
places
with
all
the
munitions
of
war
and
other
supplies
so
necessary
to
make
it
efficient
the
commendation
to
which
they
are
entitled
the
credit
due
to
this
class
of
our
officers
is
the
greater
when
it
is
considered
that
no
army
in
ancient
or
modern
times
was
even
better
appointed
or
provided
than
our
army
in
mexico
operating
in
an
enemys
country
removed
miles
from
the
seat
of
the
federal
government
its
different
corps
spread
over
a
vast
extent
of
territory
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
miles
apart
from
each
other
nothing
short
of
the
untiring
vigilance
and
extraordinary
energy
of
these
officers
could
have
enabled
them
to
provide
the
army
at
all
points
and
in
proper
season
with
all
that
was
required
for
the
most
efficient
service
it
is
but
an
act
of
justice
to
declare
that
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
several
executive
bureaus
all
under
the
immediate
eye
and
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
war
performed
their
respective
duties
with
ability
energy
and
efficiency
they
have
reaped
less
of
the
glory
of
the
war
not
having
been
personally
exposed
to
its
perils
in
battle
than
their
companions
in
arms
but
without
their
forecast
efficient
aid
and
cooperation
those
in
the
field
would
not
have
been
provided
with
the
ample
means
they
possessed
of
achieving
for
themselves
and
their
country
the
unfading
honors
which
they
have
won
for
both
when
all
these
facts
are
considered
it
may
cease
to
be
a
matter
of
so
much
amazement
abroad
how
it
happened
that
our
noble
army
in
mexico
regulars
and
volunteers
were
victorious
upon
every
battlefield
however
fearful
the
odds
against
them
the
war
with
mexico
has
thus
fully
developed
the
capacity
of
republican
governments
to
prosecute
successfully
a
just
and
necessary
foreign
war
with
all
the
vigor
usually
attributed
to
more
arbitrary
forms
of
government
it
has
been
usual
for
writers
on
public
law
to
impute
to
republics
a
want
of
that
unity
concentration
of
purpose
and
vigor
of
execution
which
are
generally
admitted
to
belong
to
the
monarchical
and
aristocratic
forms
and
this
feature
of
popular
government
has
been
supposed
to
display
itself
more
particularly
in
the
conduct
of
a
war
carried
on
in
an
enemys
territory
the
war
with
great
britain
in
was
to
a
great
extent
confined
within
our
own
limits
and
shed
but
little
light
on
this
subject
but
the
war
which
we
have
just
closed
by
an
honorable
peace
evinces
beyond
all
doubt
that
a
popular
representative
government
is
equal
to
any
emergency
which
is
likely
to
arise
in
the
affairs
of
a
nation
the
war
with
mexico
has
developed
most
strikingly
and
conspicuously
another
feature
in
our
institutions
it
is
that
without
cost
to
the
government
or
danger
to
our
liberties
we
have
in
the
bosom
of
our
society
of
freemen
available
in
a
just
and
necessary
war
virtually
a
standing
army
of
armed
citizen
soldiers
such
as
fought
the
battles
of
mexico
but
our
military
strength
does
not
consist
alone
in
our
capacity
for
extended
and
successful
operations
on
land
the
navy
is
an
important
arm
of
the
national
defense
if
the
services
of
the
navy
were
not
so
brilliant
as
those
of
the
army
in
the
late
war
with
mexico
it
was
because
they
had
no
enemy
to
meet
on
their
own
element
while
the
army
had
opportunity
of
performing
more
conspicuous
service
the
navy
largely
participated
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
both
branches
of
the
service
performed
their
whole
duty
to
the
country
for
the
able
and
gallant
services
of
the
officers
and
men
of
the
navy
acting
independently
as
well
as
in
cooperation
with
our
troops
in
the
conquest
of
the
californias
the
capture
of
vera
cruz
and
the
seizure
and
occupation
of
other
important
positions
on
the
gulf
and
pacific
coasts
the
highest
praise
is
due
their
vigilance
energy
and
skill
rendered
the
most
effective
service
in
excluding
munitions
of
war
and
other
supplies
from
the
enemy
while
they
secured
a
safe
entrance
for
abundant
supplies
for
our
own
army
our
extended
commerce
was
nowhere
interrupted
and
for
this
immunity
from
the
evils
of
war
the
country
is
indebted
to
the
navy
high
praise
is
due
to
the
officers
of
the
several
executive
bureaus
navyyards
and
stations
connected
with
the
service
all
under
the
immediate
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
the
industry
foresight
and
energy
with
which
everything
was
directed
and
furnished
to
give
efficiency
to
that
branch
of
the
service
the
same
vigilance
existed
in
directing
the
operations
of
the
navy
as
of
the
army
there
was
concert
of
action
and
of
purpose
between
the
heads
of
the
two
arms
of
the
service
by
the
orders
which
were
from
time
to
time
issued
our
vessels
of
war
on
the
pacific
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
were
stationed
in
proper
time
and
in
proper
positions
to
cooperate
efficiently
with
the
army
by
this
means
their
combined
power
was
brought
to
bear
successfully
on
the
enemy
the
great
results
which
have
been
developed
and
brought
to
light
by
this
war
will
be
of
immeasurable
importance
in
the
future
progress
of
our
country
they
will
tend
powerfully
to
preserve
us
from
foreign
collisions
and
to
enable
us
to
pursue
uninterruptedly
our
cherished
policy
of
peace
with
all
nations
entangling
alliances
with
none
occupying
as
we
do
a
more
commanding
position
among
nations
than
at
any
former
period
our
duties
and
our
responsibilities
to
ourselves
and
to
posterity
are
correspondingly
increased
this
will
be
the
more
obvious
when
we
consider
the
vast
additions
which
have
been
recently
made
to
our
territorial
possessions
and
their
great
importance
and
value
within
less
than
four
years
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
union
has
been
consummated
all
conflicting
title
to
the
oregon
territory
south
of
the
fortyninth
degree
of
north
latitude
being
all
that
was
insisted
on
by
any
of
my
predecessors
has
been
adjusted
and
new
mexico
and
upper
california
have
been
acquired
by
treaty
the
area
of
these
several
territories
according
to
a
report
carefully
prepared
by
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
from
the
most
authentic
information
in
his
possession
and
which
is
herewith
transmitted
contains
square
miles
or
acres
while
the
area
of
the
remaining
twentynine
states
and
the
territory
not
yet
organized
into
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
contains
square
miles
or
acres
these
estimates
show
that
the
territories
recently
acquired
and
over
which
our
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
dominion
have
been
extended
constitute
a
country
more
than
half
as
large
as
all
that
which
was
held
by
the
united
states
before
their
acquisition
if
oregon
be
excluded
from
the
estimate
there
will
still
remain
within
the
limits
of
texas
new
mexico
and
california
square
miles
or
acres
being
an
addition
equal
to
more
than
onethird
of
all
the
territory
owned
by
the
united
states
before
their
acquisition
and
including
oregon
nearly
as
great
an
extent
of
territory
as
the
whole
of
europe
russia
only
excepted
the
mississippi
so
lately
the
frontier
of
our
country
is
now
only
its
center
with
the
addition
of
the
late
acquisitions
the
united
states
are
now
estimated
to
be
nearly
as
large
as
the
whole
of
europe
it
is
estimated
by
the
superintendent
of
the
coast
survey
in
the
accompanying
report
that
the
extent
of
the
seacoast
of
texas
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
upward
of
miles
of
the
coast
of
upper
california
on
the
pacific
of
miles
and
of
oregon
including
the
straits
of
fuca
of
miles
making
the
whole
extent
of
seacoast
on
the
pacific
miles
and
the
whole
extent
on
both
the
pacific
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
miles
the
length
of
the
coast
on
the
atlantic
from
the
northern
limits
of
the
united
states
around
the
capes
of
florida
to
the
sabine
on
the
eastern
boundary
of
texas
is
estimated
to
be
miles
so
that
the
addition
of
seacoast
including
oregon
is
very
nearly
twothirds
as
great
as
all
we
possessed
before
and
excluding
oregon
is
an
addition
of
miles
being
nearly
equal
to
onehalf
of
the
extent
of
coast
which
we
possessed
before
these
acquisitions
we
have
now
three
great
maritime
frontson
the
atlantic
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
pacificmaking
in
the
whole
an
extent
of
seacoast
exceeding
miles
this
is
the
extent
of
the
seacoast
of
the
united
states
not
including
bays
sounds
and
small
irregularities
of
the
main
shore
and
of
the
sea
islands
if
these
be
included
the
length
of
the
shore
line
of
coast
as
estimated
by
the
superintendent
of
the
coast
survey
in
his
report
would
be
miles
it
would
be
difficult
to
calculate
the
value
of
these
immense
additions
to
our
territorial
possessions
texas
lying
contiguous
to
the
western
boundary
of
louisiana
embracing
within
its
limits
a
part
of
the
navigable
tributary
waters
of
the
mississippi
and
an
extensive
seacoast
could
not
long
have
remained
in
the
hands
of
a
foreign
power
without
endangering
the
peace
of
our
southwestern
frontier
her
products
in
the
vicinity
of
the
tributaries
of
the
mississippi
must
have
sought
a
market
through
these
streams
running
into
and
through
our
territory
and
the
danger
of
irritation
and
collision
of
interests
between
texas
as
a
foreign
state
and
ourselves
would
have
been
imminent
while
the
embarrassments
in
the
commercial
intercourse
between
them
must
have
been
constant
and
unavoidable
had
texas
fallen
into
the
hands
or
under
the
influence
and
control
of
a
strong
maritime
or
military
foreign
power
as
she
might
have
done
these
dangers
would
have
been
still
greater
they
have
been
avoided
by
her
voluntary
and
peaceful
annexation
to
the
united
states
texas
from
her
position
was
a
natural
and
almost
indispensable
part
of
our
territories
fortunately
she
has
been
restored
to
our
country
and
now
constitutes
one
of
the
states
of
our
confederacy
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
the
salubrity
of
climate
the
fertility
of
soil
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
production
of
some
of
our
most
valuable
staple
commodities
and
her
commercial
advantages
must
soon
make
her
one
of
our
most
populous
states
new
mexico
though
situated
in
the
interior
and
without
a
seacoast
is
known
to
contain
much
fertile
land
to
abound
in
rich
mines
of
the
precious
metals
and
to
be
capable
of
sustaining
a
large
population
from
its
position
it
is
the
intermediate
and
connecting
territory
between
our
settlements
and
our
possessions
in
texas
and
those
on
the
pacific
coast
upper
california
irrespective
of
the
vast
mineral
wealth
recently
developed
there
holds
at
this
day
in
point
of
value
and
importance
to
the
rest
of
the
union
the
same
relation
that
louisiana
did
when
that
fine
territory
was
acquired
from
france
fortyfive
years
ago
extending
nearly
ten
degrees
of
latitude
along
the
pacific
and
embracing
the
only
safe
and
commodious
harbors
on
that
coast
for
many
hundred
miles
with
a
temperate
climate
and
an
extensive
interior
of
fertile
lands
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
estimate
its
wealth
until
it
shall
be
brought
under
the
government
of
our
laws
and
its
resources
fully
developed
from
its
position
it
must
command
the
rich
commerce
of
china
of
asia
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
of
western
mexico
of
central
america
the
south
american
states
and
of
the
russian
possessions
bordering
on
that
ocean
a
great
emporium
will
doubtless
speedily
arise
on
the
californian
coast
which
may
be
destined
to
rival
in
importance
new
orleans
itself
the
depot
of
the
vast
commerce
which
must
exist
on
the
pacific
will
probably
be
at
some
point
on
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
will
occupy
the
same
relation
to
the
whole
western
coast
of
that
ocean
as
new
orleans
does
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
this
depot
our
numerous
whale
ships
will
resort
with
their
cargoes
to
trade
refit
and
obtain
supplies
this
of
itself
will
largely
contribute
to
build
up
a
city
which
would
soon
become
the
center
of
a
great
and
rapidly
increasing
commerce
situated
on
a
safe
harbor
sufficiently
capacious
for
all
the
navies
as
well
as
the
marine
of
the
world
and
convenient
to
excellent
timber
for
shipbuilding
owned
by
the
united
states
it
must
become
our
great
western
naval
depot
it
was
known
that
mines
of
the
precious
metals
existed
to
a
considerable
extent
in
california
at
the
time
of
its
acquisition
recent
discoveries
render
it
probable
that
these
mines
are
more
extensive
and
valuable
than
was
anticipated
the
accounts
of
the
abundance
of
gold
in
that
territory
are
of
such
an
extraordinary
character
as
would
scarcely
command
belief
were
they
not
corroborated
by
the
authentic
reports
of
officers
in
the
public
service
who
have
visited
the
mineral
district
and
derived
the
facts
which
they
detail
from
personal
observation
reluctant
to
credit
the
reports
in
general
circulation
as
to
the
quantity
of
gold
the
officer
commanding
our
forces
in
california
visited
the
mineral
district
in
july
last
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
accurate
information
on
the
subject
his
report
to
the
war
department
of
the
result
of
his
examination
and
the
facts
obtained
on
the
spot
is
herewith
laid
before
congress
when
he
visited
the
country
there
were
about
persons
engaged
in
collecting
gold
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
number
of
persons
so
employed
has
since
been
augmented
the
explorations
already
made
warrant
the
belief
that
the
supply
is
very
large
and
that
gold
is
found
at
various
places
in
an
extensive
district
of
country
information
received
from
officers
of
the
navy
and
other
sources
though
not
so
full
and
minute
confirms
the
accounts
of
the
commander
of
our
military
force
in
california
it
appears
also
from
these
reports
that
mines
of
quicksilver
are
found
in
the
vicinity
of
the
gold
region
one
of
them
is
now
being
worked
and
is
believed
to
be
among
the
most
productive
in
the
world
the
effects
produced
by
the
discovery
of
these
rich
mineral
deposits
and
the
success
which
has
attended
the
labors
of
those
who
have
resorted
to
them
have
produced
a
surprising
change
in
the
state
of
affairs
in
california
labor
commands
a
most
exorbitant
price
and
all
other
pursuits
but
that
of
searching
for
the
precious
metals
are
abandoned
nearly
the
whole
of
the
male
population
of
the
country
have
gone
to
the
gold
districts
ships
arriving
on
the
coast
are
deserted
by
their
crews
and
their
voyages
suspended
for
want
of
sailors
our
commanding
officer
there
entertains
apprehensions
that
soldiers
can
not
be
kept
in
the
public
service
without
a
large
increase
of
pay
desertions
in
his
command
have
become
frequent
and
he
recommends
that
those
who
shall
withstand
the
strong
temptation
and
remain
faithful
should
be
rewarded
this
abundance
of
gold
and
the
allengrossing
pursuit
of
it
have
already
caused
in
california
an
unprecedented
rise
in
the
price
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
that
we
may
the
more
speedily
and
fully
avail
ourselves
of
the
undeveloped
wealth
of
these
mines
it
is
deemed
of
vast
importance
that
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
be
authorized
to
be
established
at
your
present
session
in
california
among
other
signal
advantages
which
would
result
from
such
an
establishment
would
be
that
of
raising
the
gold
to
its
par
value
in
that
territory
a
branch
mint
of
the
united
states
at
the
great
commercial
depot
on
the
west
coast
would
convert
into
our
own
coin
not
only
the
gold
derived
from
our
own
rich
mines
but
also
the
bullion
and
specie
which
our
commerce
may
bring
from
the
whole
west
coast
of
central
and
south
america
the
west
coast
of
america
and
the
adjacent
interior
embrace
the
richest
and
best
mines
of
mexico
new
granada
central
america
chili
and
peru
the
bullion
and
specie
drawn
from
these
countries
and
especially
from
those
of
western
mexico
and
peru
to
an
amount
in
value
of
many
millions
of
dollars
are
now
annually
diverted
and
carried
by
the
ships
of
great
britain
to
her
own
ports
to
be
recoined
or
used
to
sustain
her
national
bank
and
thus
contribute
to
increase
her
ability
to
command
so
much
of
the
commerce
of
the
world
if
a
branch
mint
be
established
at
the
great
commercial
point
upon
that
coast
a
vast
amount
of
bullion
and
specie
would
flow
thither
to
be
recoined
and
pass
thence
to
new
orleans
new
york
and
other
atlantic
cities
the
amount
of
our
constitutional
currency
at
home
would
be
greatly
increased
while
its
circulation
abroad
would
be
promoted
it
is
well
known
to
our
merchants
trading
to
china
and
the
west
coast
of
america
that
great
inconvenience
and
loss
are
experienced
from
the
fact
that
our
coins
are
not
current
at
their
par
value
in
those
countries
the
powers
of
europe
far
removed
from
the
west
coast
of
america
by
the
atlantic
ocean
which
intervenes
and
by
a
tedious
and
dangerous
navigation
around
the
southern
cape
of
the
continent
of
america
can
never
successfully
compete
with
the
united
states
in
the
rich
and
extensive
commerce
which
is
opened
to
us
at
so
much
less
cost
by
the
acquisition
of
california
the
vast
importance
and
commercial
advantages
of
california
have
heretofore
remained
undeveloped
by
the
government
of
the
country
of
which
it
constituted
a
part
now
that
this
fine
province
is
a
part
of
our
country
all
the
states
of
the
union
some
more
immediately
and
directly
than
others
are
deeply
interested
in
the
speedy
development
of
its
wealth
and
resources
no
section
of
our
country
is
more
interested
or
will
be
more
benefited
than
the
commercial
navigating
and
manufacturing
interests
of
the
eastern
states
our
planting
and
farming
interests
in
every
part
of
the
union
will
be
greatly
benefited
by
it
as
our
commerce
and
navigation
are
enlarged
and
extended
our
exports
of
agricultural
products
and
of
manufactures
will
be
increased
and
in
the
new
markets
thus
opened
they
can
not
fail
to
command
remunerating
and
profitable
prices
the
acquisition
of
california
and
new
mexico
the
settlement
of
the
oregon
boundary
and
the
annexation
of
texas
extending
to
the
rio
grande
are
results
which
combined
are
of
greater
consequence
and
will
add
more
to
the
strength
and
wealth
of
the
nation
than
any
which
have
preceded
them
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
but
to
effect
these
great
results
not
only
california
but
new
mexico
must
be
brought
under
the
control
of
regularly
organized
governments
the
existing
condition
of
california
and
of
that
part
of
new
mexico
lying
west
of
the
rio
grande
and
without
the
limits
of
texas
imperiously
demands
that
congress
should
at
its
present
session
organize
territorial
governments
over
them
upon
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
on
the
th
of
may
last
the
temporary
governments
which
had
been
established
over
new
mexico
and
california
by
our
military
and
naval
commanders
by
virtue
of
the
rights
of
war
ceased
to
derive
any
obligatory
force
from
that
source
of
authority
and
having
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
government
and
control
over
them
under
the
authority
of
mexico
had
ceased
to
exist
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
establishing
territorial
governments
over
them
i
recommended
the
subject
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
in
my
message
communicating
the
ratified
treaty
of
peace
on
the
th
of
july
last
and
invoked
their
action
at
that
session
congress
adjourned
without
making
any
provision
for
their
government
the
inhabitants
by
the
transfer
of
their
country
had
become
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
our
laws
and
constitution
and
yet
were
left
without
any
regularly
organized
government
since
that
time
the
very
limited
power
possessed
by
the
executive
has
been
exercised
to
preserve
and
protect
them
from
the
inevitable
consequences
of
a
state
of
anarchy
the
only
government
which
remained
was
that
established
by
the
military
authority
during
the
war
regarding
this
to
be
a
de
facto
government
and
that
by
the
presumed
consent
of
the
inhabitants
it
might
be
continued
temporarily
they
were
advised
to
conform
and
submit
to
it
for
the
short
intervening
period
before
congress
would
again
assemble
and
could
legislate
on
the
subject
the
views
entertained
by
the
executive
on
this
point
are
contained
in
a
communication
of
the
secretary
of
state
dated
the
th
of
october
last
which
was
forwarded
for
publication
to
california
and
new
mexico

which

force
of
the
regular
army
which
was
serving
within
the
limits
of
the
acquired

at
the
close
of

ordered
there
for
the

of
the

to
preserve

secure
the

of

no
revenue
has
been

it
is
our
solemn
duty
to
provide
with

regularly
organized
territorial

the
causes
of
the
failure
to
do
this
at
the
last
session
of
congress
are
well
known
and
deeply
to
be
regretted
with
the
opening
prospects
of
increased
prosperity
and
national
greatness
which
the
acquisition
of
these
rich
and
extensive
territorial
possessions
affords
how
irrational
it
would
be
to
forego
or
to
reject
these
advantages
by
the
agitation
of
a
domestic
question
which
is
coeval
with
the
existence
of
our
government
itself
and
to
endanger
by
internal
strifes
geographical
divisions
and
heated
contests
for
political
power
or
for
any
other
cause
the
harmony
of
the
glorious
union
of
our
confederated
statesthat
union
which
binds
us
together
as
one
people
and
which
for
sixty
years
has
been
our
shield
and
protection
against
every
danger
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
of
posterity
how
trivial
and
insignificant
will
be
all
our
internal
divisions
and
struggles
compared
with
the
preservation
of
this
union
of
the
states
in
all
its
vigor
and
with
all
its
countless
blessings
no
patriot
would
foment
and
excite
geographical
and
sectional
divisions
no
lover
of
his
country
would
deliberately
calculate
the
value
of
the
union
future
generations
would
look
in
amazement
upon
the
folly
of
such
a
course
other
nations
at
the
present
day
would
look
upon
it
with
astonishment
and
such
of
them
as
desire
to
maintain
and
perpetuate
thrones
and
monarchical
or
aristocratical
principles
will
view
it
with
exultation
and
delight
because
in
it
they
will
see
the
elements
of
faction
which
they
hope
must
ultimately
overturn
our
system
ours
is
the
great
example
of
a
prosperous
and
free
selfgoverned
republic
commanding
the
admiration
and
the
imitation
of
all
the
lovers
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
how
solemn
therefore
is
the
duty
how
impressive
the
call
upon
us
and
upon
all
parts
of
our
country
to
cultivate
a
patriotic
spirit
of
harmony
of
goodfellowship
of
compromise
and
mutual
concession
in
the
administration
of
the
incomparable
system
of
government
formed
by
our
fathers
in
the
midst
of
almost
insuperable
difficulties
and
transmitted
to
us
with
the
injunction
that
we
should
enjoy
its
blessings
and
hand
it
down
unimpaired
to
those
who
may
come
after
us
in
view
of
the
high
and
responsible
duties
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
and
to
mankind
i
trust
you
may
be
able
at
your
present
session
to
approach
the
adjustment
of
the
only
domestic
question
which
seriously
threatens
or
probably
ever
can
threaten
to
disturb
the
harmony
and
successful
operations
of
our
system
the
immensely
valuable
possessions
of
new
mexico
and
california
are
already
inhabited
by
a
considerable
population
attracted
by
their
great
fertility
their
mineral
wealth
their
commercial
advantages
and
the
salubrity
of
the
climate
emigrants
from
the
older
states
in
great
numbers
are
already
preparing
to
seek
new
homes
in
these
inviting
regions
shall
the
dissimilarity
of
the
domestic
institutions
in
the
different
states
prevent
us
from
providing
for
them
suitable
governments
these
institutions
existed
at
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
but
the
obstacles
which
they
interposed
were
overcome
by
that
spirit
of
compromise
which
is
now
invoked
in
a
conflict
of
opinions
or
of
interests
real
or
imaginary
between
different
sections
of
our
country
neither
can
justly
demand
all
which
it
might
desire
to
obtain
each
in
the
true
spirit
of
our
institutions
should
concede
something
to
the
other
our
gallant
forces
in
the
mexican
war
by
whose
patriotism
and
unparalleled
deeds
of
arms
we
obtained
these
possessions
as
an
indemnity
for
our
just
demands
against
mexico
were
composed
of
citizens
who
belonged
to
no
one
state
or
section
of
our
union
they
were
men
from
slaveholding
and
nonslaveholding
states
from
the
north
and
the
south
from
the
east
and
the
west
they
were
all
companions
in
arms
and
fellowcitizens
of
the
same
common
country
engaged
in
the
same
common
cause
when
prosecuting
that
war
they
were
brethren
and
friends
and
shared
alike
with
each
other
common
toils
dangers
and
sufferings
now
when
their
work
is
ended
when
peace
is
restored
and
they
return
again
to
their
homes
put
off
the
habiliments
of
war
take
their
places
in
society
and
resume
their
pursuits
in
civil
life
surely
a
spirit
of
harmony
and
concession
and
of
equal
regard
for
the
rights
of
all
and
of
all
sections
of
the
union
ought
to
prevail
in
providing
governments
for
the
acquired
territoriesthe
fruits
of
their
common
service
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
and
of
every
state
contributed
to
defray
the
expenses
of
that
war
and
it
would
not
be
just
for
any
one
section
to
exclude
another
from
all
participation
in
the
acquired
territory
this
would
not
be
in
consonance
with
the
just
system
of
government
which
the
framers
of
the
constitution
adopted
the
question
is
believed
to
be
rather
abstract
than
practical
whether
slavery
ever
can
or
would
exist
in
any
portion
of
the
acquired
territory
even
if
it
were
left
to
the
option
of
the
slaveholding
states
themselves
from
the
nature
of
the
climate
and
productions
in
much
the
larger
portion
of
it
it
is
certain
it
could
never
exist
and
in
the
remainder
the
probabilities
are
it
would
not
but
however
this
may
be
the
question
involving
as
it
does
a
principle
of
equality
of
rights
of
the
separate
and
several
states
as
equal
copartners
in
the
confederacy
should
not
be
disregarded
in
organizing
governments
over
these
territories
no
duty
imposed
on
congress
by
the
constitution
requires
that
they
should
legislate
on
the
subject
of
slavery
while
their
power
to
do
so
is
not
only
seriously
questioned
but
denied
by
many
of
the
soundest
expounders
of
that
instrument
whether
congress
shall
legislate
or
not
the
people
of
the
acquired
territories
when
assembled
in
convention
to
form
state
constitutions
will
possess
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
to
determine
for
themselves
whether
slavery
shall
or
shall
not
exist
within
their
limits
if
congress
shall
abstain
from
interfering
with
the
question
the
people
of
these
territories
will
be
left
free
to
adjust
it
as
they
may
think
proper
when
they
apply
for
admission
as
states
into
the
union
no
enactment
of
congress
could
restrain
the
people
of
any
of
the
sovereign
states
of
the
union
old
or
new
north
or
south
slaveholding
or
nonslaveholding
from
determining
the
character
of
their
own
domestic
institutions
as
they
may
deem
wise
and
proper
any
and
all
the
states
possess
this
right
and
congress
can
not
deprive
them
of
it
the
people
of
georgia
might
if
they
chose
so
alter
their
constitution
as
to
abolish
slavery
within
its
limits
and
the
people
of
vermont
might
so
alter
their
constitution
as
to
admit
slavery
within
its
limits
both
states
would
possess
the
right
though
as
all
know
it
is
not
probable
that
either
would
exert
it
it
is
fortunate
for
the
peace
and
harmony
of
the
union
that
this
question
is
in
its
nature
temporary
and
can
only
continue
for
the
brief
period
which
will
intervene
before
california
and
new
mexico
may
be
admitted
as
states
into
the
union
from
the
tide
of
population
now
flowing
into
them
it
is
highly
probable
that
this
will
soon
occur
considering
the
several
states
and
the
citizens
of
the
several
states
as
equals
and
entitled
to
equal
rights
under
the
constitution
if
this
were
an
original
question
it
might
well
be
insisted
on
that
the
principle
of
noninterference
is
the
true
doctrine
and
that
congress
could
not
in
the
absence
of
any
express
grant
of
power
interfere
with
their
relative
rights
upon
a
great
emergency
however
and
under
menacing
dangers
to
the
union
the
missouri
compromise
line
in
respect
to
slavery
was
adopted
the
same
line
was
extended
farther
west
in
the
acquisition
of
texas
after
an
acquiescence
of
nearly
thirty
years
in
the
principle
of
compromise
recognized
and
established
by
these
acts
and
to
avoid
the
danger
to
the
union
which
might
follow
if
it
were
now
disregarded
i
have
heretofore
expressed
the
opinion
that
that
line
of
compromise
should
be
extended
on
the
parallel
of
from
the
western
boundary
of
texas
where
it
now
terminates
to
the
pacific
ocean
this
is
the
middle
ground
of
compromise
upon
which
the
different
sections
of
the
union
may
meet
as
they
have
heretofore
met
if
this
be
done
it
is
confidently
believed
a
large
majority
of
the
people
of
every
section
of
the
country
however
widely
their
abstract
opinions
on
the
subject
of
slavery
may
differ
would
cheerfully
and
patriotically
acquiesce
in
it
and
peace
and
harmony
would
again
fill
our
borders
the
restriction
north
of
the
line
was
only
yielded
to
in
the
case
of
missouri
and
texas
upon
a
principle
of
compromise
made
necessary
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
harmony
and
possibly
the
existence
of
the
union
it
was
upon
these
considerations
that
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
i
gave
my
sanction
to
the
principle
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
by
approving
and
signing
the
bill
to
establish
the
territorial
government
of
oregon
from
a
sincere
desire
to
preserve
the
harmony
of
the
union
and
in
deference
for
the
acts
of
my
predecessors
i
felt
constrained
to
yield
my
acquiescence
to
the
extent
to
which
they
had
gone
in
compromising
this
delicate
and
dangerous
question
but
if
congress
shall
now
reverse
the
decision
by
which
the
missouri
compromise
was
effected
and
shall
propose
to
extend
the
restriction
over
the
whole
territory
south
as
well
as
north
of
the
parallel
of
it
will
cease
to
be
a
compromise
and
must
be
regarded
as
an
original
question
if
congress
instead
of
observing
the
course
of
noninterference
leaving
the
adoption
of
their
own
domestic
institutions
to
the
people
who
may
inhabit
these
territories
or
if
instead
of
extending
the
missouri
compromise
line
to
the
pacific
shall
prefer
to
submit
the
legal
and
constitutional
questions
which
may
arise
to
the
decision
of
the
judicial
tribunals
as
was
proposed
in
a
bill
which
passed
the
senate
at
your
last
session
an
adjustment
may
be
effected
in
this
mode
if
the
whole
subject
be
referred
to
the
judiciary
all
parts
of
the
union
should
cheerfully
acquiesce
in
the
final
decision
of
the
tribunal
created
by
the
constitution
for
the
settlement
of
all
questions
which
may
arise
under
the
constitution
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
congress
is
earnestly
invoked
for
the
sake
of
the
union
its
harmony
and
our
continued
prosperity
as
a
nation
to
adjust
at
its
present
session
this
the
only
dangerous
question
which
lies
in
our
path
if
not
in
some
one
of
the
modes
suggested
in
some
other
which
may
be
satisfactory
in
anticipation
of
the
establishment
of
regular
governments
over
the
acquired
territories
a
joint
commission
of
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
has
been
ordered
to
proceed
to
the
coast
of
california
and
oregon
for
the
purpose
of
making
reconnoissances
and
a
report
as
to
the
proper
sites
for
the
erection
of
fortifications
or
other
defensive
works
on
land
and
of
suitable
situations
for
naval
stations
the
information
which
may
be
expected
from
a
scientific
and
skillful
examination
of
the
whole
face
of
the
coast
will
be
eminently
useful
to
congress
when
they
come
to
consider
the
propriety
of
making
appropriations
for
these
great
national
objects
proper
defenses
on
land
will
be
necessary
for
the
security
and
protection
of
our
possessions
and
the
establishment
of
navyyards
and
a
dock
for
the
repair
and
construction
of
vessels
will
be
important
alike
to
our
navy
and
commercial
marine
without
such
establishments
every
vessel
whether
of
the
navy
or
of
the
merchant
service
requiring
repair
must
at
great
expense
come
round
cape
horn
to
one
of
our
atlantic
yards
for
that
purpose
with
such
establishments
vessels
it
is
believed
may
be
built
or
repaired
as
cheaply
in
california
as
upon
the
atlantic
coast
they
would
give
employment
to
many
of
our
enterprising
shipbuilders
and
mechanics
and
greatly
facilitate
and
enlarge
our
commerce
in
the
pacific
as
it
is
ascertained
that
mines
of
gold
silver
copper
and
quicksilver
exist
in
new
mexico
and
california
and
that
nearly
all
the
lands
where
they
are
found
belong
to
the
united
states
it
is
deemed
important
to
the
public
interest
that
provision
be
made
for
a
geological
and
mineralogical
examination
of
these
regions
measures
should
be
adopted
to
preserve
the
mineral
lands
especially
such
as
contain
the
precious
metals
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
or
if
brought
into
market
to
separate
them
from
the
farming
lands
and
dispose
of
them
in
such
manner
as
to
secure
a
large
return
of
money
to
the
treasury
and
at
the
same
time
to
lead
to
the
development
of
their
wealth
by
individual
proprietors
and
purchasers
to
do
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
provide
for
an
immediate
survey
and
location
of
the
lots
if
congress
should
deem
it
proper
to
dispose
of
the
mineral
lands
they
should
be
sold
in
small
quantities
and
at
a
fixed
minimum
price
i
recommend
that
surveyorsgenerals
offices
be
authorized
to
be
established
in
new
mexico
and
california
and
provision
made
for
surveying
and
bringing
the
public
lands
into
market
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
in
disposing
of
these
lands
i
recommend
that
the
right
of
preemption
be
secured
and
liberal
grants
made
to
the
early
emigrants
who
have
settled
or
may
settle
upon
them
it
will
be
important
to
extend
our
revenue
laws
over
these
territories
and
especially
over
california
at
an
early
period
there
is
already
a
considerable
commerce
with
california
and
until
ports
of
entry
shall
be
established
and
collectors
appointed
no
revenue
can
be
received
if
these
and
other
necessary
and
proper
measures
be
adopted
for
the
development
of
the
wealth
and
resources
of
new
mexico
and
california
and
regular
territorial
governments
be
established
over
them
such
will
probably
be
the
rapid
enlargement
of
our
commerce
and
navigation
and
such
the
addition
to
the
national
wealth
that
the
present
generation
may
live
to
witness
the
controlling
commercial
and
monetary
power
of
the
world
transferred
from
london
and
other
european
emporiums
to
the
city
of
new
york
the
apprehensions
which
were
entertained
by
some
of
our
statesmen
in
the
earlier
periods
of
the
government
that
our
system
was
incapable
of
operating
with
sufficient
energy
and
success
over
largely
extended
territorial
limits
and
that
if
this
were
attempted
it
would
fall
to
pieces
by
its
own
weakness
have
been
dissipated
by
our
experience
by
the
division
of
power
between
the
states
and
federal
government
the
latter
is
found
to
operate
with
as
much
energy
in
the
extremes
as
in
the
center
it
is
as
efficient
in
the
remotest
of
the
thirty
states
which
now
compose
the
union
as
it
was
in
the
thirteen
states
which
formed
our
constitution
indeed
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
if
our
present
population
had
been
confined
within
the
limits
of
the
original
thirteen
states
the
tendencies
to
centralization
and
consolidation
would
not
have
been
such
as
to
have
encroached
upon
the
essential
reserved
rights
of
the
states
and
thus
to
have
made
the
federal
government
a
widely
different
one
practically
from
what
it
is
in
theory
and
was
intended
to
be
by
its
framers
so
far
from
entertaining
apprehensions
of
the
safety
of
our
system
by
the
extension
of
our
territory
the
belief
is
confidently
entertained
that
each
new
state
gives
strength
and
an
additional
guaranty
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
itself
in
pursuance
of
the
provisions
of
the
thirteenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
peace
friendship
limits
and
settlement
with
the
republic
of
mexico
and
of
the
act
of
july
claims
of
our
citizens
which
had
been
already
liquidated
and
decided
against
the
mexican
republic
amounting
with
the
interest
thereon
to
have
been
liquidated
and
paid
there
remain
to
be
paid
of
these
claims
congress
at
its
last
session
having
made
no
provision
for
executing
the
fifteenth
article
of
the
treaty
by
which
the
united
states
assume
to
make
satisfaction
for
the
unliquidated
claims
of
our
citizens
against
mexico
to
an
amount
not
exceeding
three
and
a
quarter
millions
of
dollars
the
subject
is
again
recommended
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
with
mexico
took
place
on
the
th
of
may
within
one
year
after
that
time
the
commissioner
and
surveyor
which
each
government
stipulates
to
appoint
are
required
to
meet
at
the
port
of
san
diego
and
proceed
to
run
and
mark
the
said
boundary
in
its
whole
course
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
it
will
be
seen
from
this
provision
that
the
period
within
which
a
commissioner
and
surveyor
of
the
respective
governments
are
to
meet
at
san
diego
will
expire
on
the
th
of
may
congress
at
the
close
of
its
last
session
made
an
appropriation
for
the
expenses
of
running
and
marking
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
countries
but
did
not
fix
the
amount
of
salary
which
should
be
paid
to
the
commissioner
and
surveyor
to
be
appointed
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
it
is
desirable
that
the
amount
of
compensation
which
they
shall
receive
should
be
prescribed
by
law
and
not
left
as
at
present
to
executive
discretion
measures
were
adopted
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
to
organize
the
territorial
government
of
oregon
as
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
last
the
governor
and
marshal
of
the
territory
accompanied
by
a
small
military
escort
left
the
frontier
of
missouri
in
september
last
and
took
the
southern
route
by
the
way
of
santa
fe
and
the
river
gila
to
california
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
thence
in
one
of
our
vessels
of
war
to
their
destination
the
governor
was
fully
advised
of
the
great
importance
of
his
early
arrival
in
the
country
and
it
is
confidently
believed
he
may
reach
oregon
in
the
latter
part
of
the
present
month
or
early
in
the
next
the
other
officers
for
the
territory
have
proceeded
by
sea
in
the
month
of
may
last
i
communicated
information
to
congress
that
an
indian
war
had
broken
out
in
oregon
and
recommended
that
authority
be
given
to
raise
an
adequate
number
of
volunteers
to
proceed
without
delay
to
the
assistance
of
our
fellowcitizens
in
that
territory
the
authority
to
raise
such
a
force
not
having
been
granted
by
congress
as
soon
as
their
services
could
be
dispensed
with
in
mexico
orders
were
issued
to
the
regiment
of
mounted
riflemen
to
proceed
to
jefferson
barracks
in
missouri
and
to
prepare
to
march
to
oregon
as
soon
as
the
necessary
provision
could
be
made
shortly
before
it
was
ready
to
march
it
was
arrested
by
the
provision
of
the
act
passed
by
congress
on
the
last
day
of
the
last
session
which
directed
that
all
the
noncommissioned
officers
musicians
and
privates
of
that
regiment
who
had
been
in
service
in
mexico
should
upon
their
application
be
entitled
to
be
discharged
the
effect
of
this
provision
was
to
disband
the
rank
and
file
of
the
regiment
and
before
their
places
could
be
filled
by
recruits
the
season
had
so
far
advanced
that
it
was
impracticable
for
it
to
proceed
until
the
opening
of
the
next
spring
in
the
month
of
october
last
the
accompanying
communication
was
received
from
the
governor
of
the
temporary
government
of
oregon
giving
information
of
the
continuance
of
the
indian
disturbances
and
of
the
destitution
and
defenseless
condition
of
the
inhabitants
orders
were
immediately
transmitted
to
the
commander
of
our
squadron
in
the
pacific
to
dispatch
to
their
assistance
a
part
of
the
naval
forces
on
that
station
to
furnish
them
with
arms
and
ammunition
and
to
continue
to
give
them
such
aid
and
protection
as
the
navy
could
afford
until
the
army
could
reach
the
country
it
is
the
policy
of
humanity
and
one
which
has
always
been
pursued
by
the
united
states
to
cultivate
the
good
will
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
this
continent
and
to
restrain
them
from
making
war
and
indulging
in
excesses
by
mild
means
rather
than
by
force
that
this
could
have
been
done
with
the
tribes
in
oregon
had
that
territory
been
brought
under
the
government
of
our
laws
at
an
earlier
period
and
had
other
suitable
measures
been
adopted
by
congress
such
as
now
exist
in
our
intercourse
with
the
other
indian
tribes
within
our
limits
can
not
be
doubted
indeed
the
immediate
and
only
cause
of
the
existing
hostility
of
the
indians
of
oregon
is
represented
to
have
been
the
long
delay
of
the
united
states
in
making
to
them
some
trifling
compensation
in
such
articles
as
they
wanted
for
the
country
now
occupied
by
our
emigrants
which
the
indians
claimed
and
over
which
they
formerly
roamed
this
compensation
had
been
promised
to
them
by
the
temporary
government
established
in
oregon
but
its
fulfillment
had
been
postponed
from
time
to
time
for
nearly
two
years
whilst
those
who
made
it
had
been
anxiously
waiting
for
congress
to
establish
a
territorial
government
over
the
country
the
indians
became
at
length
distrustful
of
their
good
faith
and
sought
redress
by
plunder
and
massacre
which
finally
led
to
the
present
difficulties
a
few
thousand
dollars
in
suitable
presents
as
a
compensation
for
the
country
which
had
been
taken
possession
of
by
our
citizens
would
have
satisfied
the
indians
and
have
prevented
the
war
a
small
amount
properly
distributed
it
is
confidently
believed
would
soon
restore
quiet
in
this
indian
war
our
fellowcitizens
of
oregon
have
been
compelled
to
take
the
field
in
their
own
defense
have
performed
valuable
military
services
and
been
subjected
to
expenses
which
have
fallen
heavily
upon
them
justice
demands
that
provision
should
be
made
by
congress
to
compensate
them
for
their
services
and
to
refund
to
them
the
necessary
expenses
which
they
have
incurred
i
repeat
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
to
congress
that
provision
be
made
for
the
appointment
of
a
suitable
number
of
indian
agents
to
reside
among
the
tribes
of
oregon
and
that
a
small
sum
be
appropriated
to
enable
these
agents
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
them
if
this
be
done
the
presence
of
a
small
military
force
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
to
keep
them
in
check
and
preserve
peace
i
recommend
that
similar
provisions
be
made
as
regards
the
tribes
inhabiting
northern
texas
new
mexico
california
and
the
extensive
region
lying
between
our
settlements
in
missouri
and
these
possessions
as
the
most
effective
means
of
preserving
peace
upon
our
borders
and
within
the
recently
acquired
territories
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
present
in
his
annual
report
a
highly
satisfactory
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
finances
the
imports
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
exported
was
leaving
in
the
country
for
domestic
use
the
value
of
the
exports
for
the
same
period
was
consisting
of
domestic
productions
amounting
to
and
of
foreign
articles
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
same
period
exclusive
of
loans
amounted
to
of
which
there
was
derived
from
customs
from
sales
of
public
lands
and
from
miscellaneous
and
incidental
sources
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
revenue
from
customs
for
the
last
fiscal
year
exceeded
by
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
last
annual
report
and
that
the
aggregate
receipts
during
the
same
period
from
customs
lands
and
miscellaneous
sources
also
exceeded
the
estimate
by
the
sum
of
indicating
however
a
very
near
approach
in
the
estimate
to
the
actual
result
the
expenditures
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
including
those
for
the
war
and
exclusive
of
payments
of
principal
and
interest
for
the
public
debt
were
it
is
estimated
that
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
including
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
last
will
amount
to
the
sum
of
of
which
it
is
estimated
will
be
derived
from
customs
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
and
from
miscellaneous
and
incidental
sources
including
the
premium
upon
the
loan
and
the
amount
paid
and
to
be
paid
into
the
treasury
on
account
of
military
contributions
in
mexico
and
the
sales
of
arms
and
vessels
and
other
public
property
rendered
unnecessary
for
the
use
of
the
government
by
the
termination
of
the
war
and
from
loans
already
negotiated
including
treasury
notes
funded
which
together
with
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
last
make
the
sum
estimated
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
including
the
necessary
payment
on
account
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
public
debt
and
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
first
installment
due
to
mexico
on
the
th
of
may
next
and
other
expenditures
growing
out
of
the
war
to
be
paid
during
the
present
year
will
amount
including
the
reimbursement
of
treasury
notes
to
the
sum
of
leaving
an
estimated
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
present
as
required
by
law
the
estimate
of
the
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
as
estimated
for
that
year
are
including
for
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
and
for
the
principal
and
interest
due
to
mexico
on
the
th
of
may
leaving
the
sum
of
which
it
is
believed
will
be
ample
for
the
ordinary
peace
expenditures
the
operations
of
the
tariff
act
of
have
been
such
during
the
past
year
as
fully
to
meet
the
public
expectation
and
to
confirm
the
opinion
heretofore
expressed
of
the
wisdom
of
the
change
in
our
revenue
system
which
was
effected
by
it
the
receipts
under
it
into
the
treasury
for
the
first
fiscal
year
after
its
enactment
exceeded
by
the
sum
of
the
amount
collected
during
the
last
fiscal
year
under
the
tariff
act
of
ending
the
th
of
june
the
total
revenue
realized
from
the
commencement
of
its
operation
on
the
st
of
december
until
the
close
of
the
last
quarter
on
the
th
of
september
last
being
twentytwo
months
was
being
a
much
larger
sum
than
was
ever
before
received
from
duties
during
any
equal
period
under
the
tariff
acts
of
and
whilst
by
the
repeal
of
highly
protective
and
prohibitory
duties
the
revenue
has
been
increased
the
taxes
on
the
people
have
been
diminished
they
have
been
relieved
from
the
heavy
amounts
with
which
they
were
burdened
under
former
laws
in
the
form
of
increased
prices
or
bounties
paid
to
favored
classes
and
pursuits
the
predictions
which
were
made
that
the
tariff
act
of
would
reduce
the
amount
of
revenue
below
that
collected
under
the
act
of
and
would
prostrate
the
business
and
destroy
the
prosperity
of
the
country
have
not
been
verified
with
an
increased
and
increasing
revenue
the
finances
are
in
a
highly
flourishing
condition
agriculture
commerce
and
navigation
are
prosperous
the
prices
of
manufactured
fabrics
and
of
other
products
are
much
less
injuriously
affected
than
was
to
have
been
anticipated
from
the
unprecedented
revulsions
which
during
the
last
and
the
present
year
have
overwhelmed
the
industry
and
paralyzed
the
credit
and
commerce
of
so
many
great
and
enlightened
nations
of
europe
severe
commercial
revulsions
abroad
have
always
heretofore
operated
to
depress
and
often
to
affect
disastrously
almost
every
branch
of
american
industry
the
temporary
depression
of
a
portion
of
our
manufacturing
interests
is
the
effect
of
foreign
causes
and
is
far
less
severe
than
has
prevailed
on
all
former
similar
occasions
it
is
believed
that
looking
to
the
great
aggregate
of
all
our
interests
the
whole
country
was
never
more
prosperous
than
at
the
present
period
and
never
more
rapidly
advancing
in
wealth
and
population
neither
the
foreign
war
in
which
we
have
been
involved
nor
the
loans
which
have
absorbed
so
large
a
portion
of
our
capital
nor
the
commercial
revulsion
in
great
britain
in
nor
the
paralysis
of
credit
and
commerce
throughout
europe
in
have
affected
injuriously
to
any
considerable
extent
any
of
the
great
interests
of
the
country
or
arrested
our
onward
march
to
greatness
wealth
and
power
had
the
disturbances
in
europe
not
occurred
our
commerce
would
undoubtedly
have
been
still
more
extended
and
would
have
added
still
more
to
the
national
wealth
and
public
prosperity
but
notwithstanding
these
disturbances
the
operations
of
the
revenue
system
established
by
the
tariff
act
of
have
been
so
generally
beneficial
to
the
government
and
the
business
of
the
country
that
no
change
in
its
provisions
is
demanded
by
a
wise
public
policy
and
none
is
recommended
the
operations
of
the
constitutional
treasury
established
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
in
the
receipt
custody
and
disbursement
of
the
public
money
have
continued
to
be
successful
under
this
system
the
public
finances
have
been
carried
through
a
foreign
war
involving
the
necessity
of
loans
and
extraordinary
expenditures
and
requiring
distant
transfers
and
disbursements
without
embarrassment
and
no
loss
has
occurred
of
any
of
the
public
money
deposited
under
its
provisions
whilst
it
has
proved
to
be
safe
and
useful
to
the
government
its
effects
have
been
most
beneficial
upon
the
business
of
the
country
it
has
tended
powerfully
to
secure
an
exemption
from
that
inflation
and
fluctuation
of
the
paper
currency
so
injurious
to
domestic
industry
and
rendering
so
uncertain
the
rewards
of
labor
and
it
is
believed
has
largely
contributed
to
preserve
the
whole
country
from
a
serious
commercial
revulsion
such
as
often
occurred
under
the
bank
deposit
system
in
the
year
there
was
a
revulsion
in
the
business
of
great
britain
of
great
extent
and
intensity
which
was
followed
by
failures
in
that
kingdom
unprecedented
in
number
and
amount
of
losses
this
is
believed
to
be
the
first
instance
when
such
disastrous
bankruptcies
occurring
in
a
country
with
which
we
have
such
extensive
commerce
produced
little
or
no
injurious
effect
upon
our
trade
or
currency
we
remained
but
little
affected
in
our
money
market
and
our
business
and
industry
were
still
prosperous
and
progressive
during
the
present
year
nearly
the
whole
continent
of
europe
has
been
convulsed
by
civil
war
and
revolutions
attended
by
numerous
bankruptcies
by
an
unprecedented
fall
in
their
public
securities
and
an
almost
universal
paralysis
of
commerce
and
industry
and
yet
although
our
trade
and
the
prices
of
our
products
must
have
been
somewhat
unfavorably
affected
by
these
causes
we
have
escaped
a
revulsion
our
money
market
is
comparatively
easy
and
public
and
private
credit
have
advanced
and
improved
it
is
confidently
believed
that
we
have
been
saved
from
their
effect
by
the
salutary
operation
of
the
constitutional
treasury
it
is
certain
that
if
the
twentyfour
millions
of
specie
imported
into
the
country
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
had
gone
into
the
banks
as
to
a
great
extent
it
must
have
done
it
would
in
the
absence
of
this
system
have
been
made
the
basis
of
augmented
bank
paper
issues
probably
to
an
amount
not
less
than
or
producing
as
an
inevitable
consequence
of
an
inflated
currency
extravagant
prices
for
a
time
and
wild
speculation
which
must
have
been
followed
on
the
reflux
to
europe
the
succeeding
year
of
so
much
of
that
specie
by
the
prostration
of
the
business
of
the
country
the
suspension
of
the
banks
and
most
extensive
bankruptcies
occurring
as
this
would
have
done
at
a
period
when
the
country
was
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
when
considerable
loans
of
specie
were
required
for
distant
disbursements
and
when
the
banks
the
fiscal
agents
of
the
government
and
the
depositories
of
its
money
were
suspended
the
public
credit
must
have
sunk
and
many
millions
of
dollars
as
was
the
case
during
the
war
of
must
have
been
sacrificed
in
discounts
upon
loans
and
upon
the
depreciated
paper
currency
which
the
government
would
have
been
compelled
to
use
under
the
operations
of
the
constitutional
treasury
not
a
dollar
has
been
lost
by
the
depreciation
of
the
currency
the
loans
required
to
prosecute
the
war
with
mexico
were
negotiated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
above
par
realizing
a
large
premium
to
the
government
the
restraining
effect
of
the
system
upon
the
tendencies
to
excessive
paper
issues
by
banks
has
saved
the
government
from
heavy
losses
and
thousands
of
our
business
men
from
bankruptcy
and
ruin
the
wisdom
of
the
system
has
been
tested
by
the
experience
of
the
last
two
years
and
it
is
the
dictate
of
sound
policy
that
it
should
remain
undisturbed
the
modifications
in
some
of
the
details
of
this
measure
involving
none
of
its
essential
principles
heretofore
recommended
are
again
presented
for
your
favorable
consideration
in
my
message
of
the
th
of
july
last
transmitting
to
congress
the
ratified
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
i
recommended
the
adoption
of
measures
for
the
speedy
payment
of
the
public
debt
in
reiterating
that
recommendation
i
refer
you
to
the
considerations
presented
in
that
message
in
its
support
the
public
debt
including
that
authorized
to
be
negotiated
in
pursuance
of
existing
laws
and
including
treasury
notes
amounted
at
that
time
to
funded
stock
of
the
united
states
amounting
to
about
half
a
million
of
dollars
has
been
purchased
as
authorized
by
law
since
that
period
and
the
public
debt
has
thus
been
reduced
the
details
of
which
will
be
presented
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
estimates
of
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
is
believed
will
be
ample
for
all
necessary
purposes
if
the
appropriations
made
by
congress
shall
not
exceed
the
amount
estimated
the
means
in
the
treasury
will
be
sufficient
to
defray
all
the
expenses
of
the
government
to
pay
off
the
next
installment
of
to
mexico
which
will
fall
due
on
the
th
of
may
next
and
still
a
considerable
surplus
will
remain
which
should
be
applied
to
the
further
purchase
of
the
public
stock
and
reduction
of
the
debt
should
enlarged
appropriations
be
made
the
necessary
consequence
will
be
to
postpone
the
payment
of
the
debt
though
our
debt
as
compared
with
that
of
most
other
nations
is
small
it
is
our
true
policy
and
in
harmony
with
the
genius
of
our
institutions
that
we
should
present
to
the
world
the
rare
spectacle
of
a
great
republic
possessing
vast
resources
and
wealth
wholly
exempt
from
public
indebtedness
this
would
add
still
more
to
our
strength
and
give
to
us
a
still
more
commanding
position
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
public
expenditures
should
be
economical
and
be
confined
to
such
necessary
objects
as
are
clearly
within
the
powers
of
congress
all
such
as
are
not
absolutely
demanded
should
be
postponed
and
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
should
be
a
cardinal
principle
of
our
public
policy
for
the
reason
assigned
in
my
last
annual
message
i
repeat
the
recommendation
that
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
be
established
at
the
city
of
new
york
the
importance
of
this
measure
is
greatly
increased
by
the
acquisition
of
the
rich
mines
of
the
precious
metals
in
new
mexico
and
california
and
especially
in
the
latter
i
repeat
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
in
favor
of
the
graduation
and
reduction
of
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
been
long
offered
in
the
market
and
have
remained
unsold
and
in
favor
of
extending
the
rights
of
preemption
to
actual
settlers
on
the
unsurveyed
as
well
as
the
surveyed
lands
the
condition
and
operations
of
the
army
and
the
state
of
other
branches
of
the
public
service
under
the
supervision
of
the
war
department
are
satisfactorily
presented
in
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
on
the
return
of
peace
our
forces
were
withdrawn
from
mexico
and
the
volunteers
and
that
portion
of
the
regular
army
engaged
for
the
war
were
disbanded
orders
have
been
issued
for
stationing
the
forces
of
our
permanent
establishment
at
various
positions
in
our
extended
country
where
troops
may
be
required
owing
to
the
remoteness
of
some
of
these
positions
the
detachments
have
not
yet
reached
their
destination
notwithstanding
the
extension
of
the
limits
of
our
country
and
the
forces
required
in
the
new
territories
it
is
confidently
believed
that
our
present
military
establishment
is
sufficient
for
all
exigencies
so
long
as
our
peaceful
relations
remain
undisturbed
of
the
amount
of
military
contributions
collected
in
mexico
the
sum
of
was
applied
toward
the
payment
of
the
first
installment
due
under
the
treaty
with
mexico
the
further
sum
of
has
been
paid
into
the
treasury
and
unexpended
balances
still
remain
in
the
hands
of
disbursing
officers
and
those
who
were
engaged
in
the
collection
of
these
moneys
after
the
proclamation
of
peace
no
further
disbursements
were
made
of
any
unexpended
moneys
arising
from
this
source
the
balances
on
hand
were
directed
to
be
paid
into
the
treasury
and
individual
claims
on
the
fund
will
remain
unadjusted
until
congress
shall
authorize
their
settlement
and
payment
these
claims
are
not
considerable
in
number
or
amount
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
regard
to
legislation
on
this
subject
our
indian
relations
are
presented
in
a
most
favorable
view
in
the
report
from
the
war
department
the
wisdom
of
our
policy
in
regard
to
the
tribes
within
our
limits
is
clearly
manifested
by
their
improved
and
rapidly
improving
condition
a
most
important
treaty
with
the
menomonies
has
been
recently
negotiated
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
person
by
which
all
their
land
in
the
state
of
wisconsinbeing
about
acreshas
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
this
treaty
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
at
an
early
period
of
your
present
session
within
the
last
four
years
eight
important
treaties
have
been
negotiated
with
different
indian
tribes
and
at
a
cost
of
indian
lands
to
the
amount
of
more
than
acres
have
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
and
provision
has
been
made
for
settling
in
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
the
tribes
which
occupied
this
large
extent
of
the
public
domain
the
title
to
all
the
indian
lands
within
the
several
states
of
our
union
with
the
exception
of
a
few
small
reservations
is
now
extinguished
and
a
vast
region
opened
for
settlement
and
cultivation
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
gives
a
satisfactory
exhibit
of
the
operations
and
condition
of
that
branch
of
the
public
service
a
number
of
small
vessels
suitable
for
entering
the
mouths
of
rivers
were
judiciously
purchased
during
the
war
and
gave
great
efficiency
to
the
squadron
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
the
return
of
peace
when
no
longer
valuable
for
naval
purposes
and
liable
to
constant
deterioration
they
were
sold
and
the
money
placed
in
the
treasury
the
number
of
men
in
the
naval
service
authorized
by
law
during
the
war
has
been
reduced
by
discharges
below
the
maximum
fixed
for
the
peace
establishment
adequate
squadrons
are
maintained
in
the
several
quarters
of
the
globe
where
experience
has
shown
their
services
may
be
most
usefully
employed
and
the
naval
service
was
never
in
a
condition
of
higher
discipline
or
greater
efficiency
i
invite
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
on
the
subject
of
the
marine
corps
the
reduction
of
the
corps
at
the
end
of
the
war
required
that
four
officers
of
each
of
the
three
lower
grades
should
be
dropped
from
the
rolls
a
board
of
officers
made
the
selection
and
those
designated
were
necessarily
dismissed
but
without
any
alleged
fault
i
concur
in
opinion
with
the
secretary
that
the
service
would
be
improved
by
reducing
the
number
of
landsmen
and
increasing
the
marines
such
a
measure
would
justify
an
increase
of
the
number
of
officers
to
the
extent
of
the
reduction
by
dismissal
and
still
the
corps
would
have
fewer
officers
than
a
corresponding
number
of
men
in
the
army
the
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
in
steamships
convertible
into
war
steamers
promise
to
realize
all
the
benefits
to
our
commerce
and
to
the
navy
which
were
anticipated
the
first
steamer
thus
secured
to
the
government
was
launched
in
january
there
are
now
seven
and
in
another
year
there
will
probably
be
not
less
than
seventeen
afloat
while
this
great
national
advantage
is
secured
our
social
and
commercial
intercourse
is
increased
and
promoted
with
germany
great
britain
and
other
parts
of
europe
with
all
the
countries
on
the
west
coast
of
our
continent
especially
with
oregon
and
california
and
between
the
northern
and
southern
sections
of
the
united
states
considerable
revenue
may
be
expected
from
postages
but
the
connected
line
from
new
york
to
chagres
and
thence
across
the
isthmus
to
oregon
can
not
fail
to
exert
a
beneficial
influence
not
now
to
be
estimated
on
the
interests
of
the
manufactures
commerce
navigation
and
currency
of
the
united
states
as
an
important
part
of
the
system
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
establishment
of
the
proposed
line
of
steamers
between
new
orleans
and
vera
cruz
it
promises
the
most
happy
results
in
cementing
friendship
between
the
two
republics
and
extending
reciprocal
benefits
to
the
trade
and
manufactures
of
both
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
will
make
known
to
you
the
operations
of
that
department
for
the
past
year
it
is
gratifying
to
find
the
revenues
of
the
department
under
the
rates
of
postage
now
established
by
law
so
rapidly
increasing
the
gross
amount
of
postages
during
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
exceeding
the
annual
average
received
for
the
nine
years
immediately
preceding
the
passage
of
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
by
the
sum
of
and
exceeding
the
amount
received
for
the
year
ending
the
th
of
june
by
the
sum
of
the
expenditures
for
the
year
excluding
the
sum
of
allowed
by
congress
at
its
last
session
to
individual
claimants
and
including
the
sum
of
paid
for
the
services
of
the
line
of
steamers
between
bremen
and
new
york
amounted
to
which
is
less
than
the
annual
average
for
the
nine
years
previous
to
the
act
of
by
the
mail
routes
on
the
th
day
of
june
last
were
miles
in
extent
being
an
increase
during
the
last
year
of
miles
the
mails
were
transported
over
them
during
the
same
time
miles
making
an
increase
of
transportation
for
the
year
of
miles
whilst
the
expense
was
less
than
that
of
the
previous
year
by
the
increase
in
the
mail
transportation
within
the
last
three
years
has
been
miles
whilst
the
expenses
were
reduced
making
an
increase
of
service
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
and
a
reduction
in
the
expenses
of
more
than
per
cent
during
the
past
year
there
have
been
employed
under
contracts
with
the
postoffice
department
two
ocean
steamers
in
conveying
the
mails
monthly
between
new
york
and
bremen
and
one
since
october
last
performing
semimonthly
service
between
charleston
and
havana
and
a
contract
has
been
made
for
the
transportation
of
the
pacific
mails
across
the
isthmus
from
chagres
to
panama
under
the
authority
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
three
ocean
steamers
have
been
constructed
and
sent
to
the
pacific
and
are
expected
to
enter
upon
the
mail
service
between
panama
and
oregon
and
the
intermediate
ports
on
the
st
of
january
next
and
a
fourth
has
been
engaged
by
him
for
the
service
between
havana
and
chagres
so
that
a
regular
monthly
mail
line
will
be
kept
up
after
that
time
between
the
united
states
and
our
territories
on
the
pacific
notwithstanding
this
great
increase
in
the
mail
service
should
the
revenue
continue
to
increase
the
present
year
as
it
did
in
the
last
there
will
be
received
near
more
than
the
expenditures
these
considerations
have
satisfied
the
postmastergeneral
that
with
certain
modifications
of
the
act
of
the
revenue
may
be
still
further
increased
and
a
reduction
of
postages
made
to
a
uniform
rate
of
cents
without
an
interference
with
the
principle
which
has
been
constantly
and
properly
enforced
of
making
that
department
sustain
itself
a
welldigested
cheappostage
system
is
the
best
means
of
diffusing
intelligence
among
the
people
and
is
of
so
much
importance
in
a
country
so
extensive
as
that
of
the
united
states
that
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
its
improvement
nothing
can
retard
the
onward
progress
of
our
country
and
prevent
us
from
assuming
and
maintaining
the
first
rank
among
nations
but
a
disregard
of
the
experience
of
the
past
and
a
recurrence
to
an
unwise
public
policy
we
have
just
closed
a
foreign
war
by
an
honorable
peacea
war
rendered
necessary
and
unavoidable
in
vindication
of
the
national
rights
and
honor
the
present
condition
of
the
country
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
that
which
existed
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
war
with
great
britain
in
and
the
occasion
is
deemed
to
be
a
proper
one
to
take
a
retrospect
of
the
measures
of
public
policy
which
followed
that
war
there
was
at
that
period
of
our
history
a
departure
from
our
earlier
policy
the
enlargement
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
by
construction
which
obtained
was
not
warranted
by
any
just
interpretation
of
the
constitution
a
few
years
after
the
close
of
that
war
a
series
of
measures
was
adopted
which
united
and
combined
constituted
what
was
termed
by
their
authors
and
advocates
the
american
system
the
introduction
of
the
new
policy
was
for
a
time
favored
by
the
condition
of
the
country
by
the
heavy
debt
which
had
been
contracted
during
the
war
by
the
depression
of
the
public
credit
by
the
deranged
state
of
the
finances
and
the
currency
and
by
the
commercial
and
pecuniary
embarrassment
which
extensively
prevailed
these
were
not
the
only
causes
which
led
to
its
establishment
the
events
of
the
war
with
great
britain
and
the
embarrassments
which
had
attended
its
prosecution
had
left
on
the
minds
of
many
of
our
statesmen
the
impression
that
our
government
was
not
strong
enough
and
that
to
wield
its
resources
successfully
in
great
emergencies
and
especially
in
war
more
power
should
be
concentrated
in
its
hands
this
increased
power
they
did
not
seek
to
obtain
by
the
legitimate
and
prescribed
modean
amendment
of
the
constitutionbut
by
construction
they
saw
governments
in
the
old
world
based
upon
different
orders
of
society
and
so
constituted
as
to
throw
the
whole
power
of
nations
into
the
hands
of
a
few
who
taxed
and
controlled
the
many
without
responsibility
or
restraint
in
that
arrangement
they
conceived
the
strength
of
nations
in
war
consisted
there
was
also
something
fascinating
in
the
ease
luxury
and
display
of
the
higher
orders
who
drew
their
wealth
from
the
toil
of
the
laboring
millions
the
authors
of
the
system
drew
their
ideas
of
political
economy
from
what
they
had
witnessed
in
europe
and
particularly
in
great
britain
they
had
viewed
the
enormous
wealth
concentrated
in
few
hands
and
had
seen
the
splendor
of
the
overgrown
establishments
of
an
aristocracy
which
was
upheld
by
the
restrictive
policy
they
forgot
to
look
down
upon
the
poorer
classes
of
the
english
population
upon
whose
daily
and
yearly
labor
the
great
establishments
they
so
much
admired
were
sustained
and
supported
they
failed
to
perceive
that
the
scantily
fed
and
halfclad
operatives
were
not
only
in
abject
poverty
but
were
bound
in
chains
of
oppressive
servitude
for
the
benefit
of
favored
classes
who
were
the
exclusive
objects
of
the
care
of
the
government
it
was
not
possible
to
reconstruct
society
in
the
united
states
upon
the
european
plan
here
there
was
a
written
constitution
by
which
orders
and
titles
were
not
recognized
or
tolerated
a
system
of
measures
was
therefore
devised
calculated
if
not
intended
to
withdraw
power
gradually
and
silently
from
the
states
and
the
mass
of
the
people
and
by
construction
to
approximate
our
government
to
the
european
models
substituting
an
aristocracy
of
wealth
for
that
of
orders
and
titles
without
reflecting
upon
the
dissimilarity
of
our
institutions
and
of
the
condition
of
our
people
and
those
of
europe
they
conceived
the
vain
idea
of
building
up
in
the
united
states
a
system
similar
to
that
which
they
admired
abroad
great
britain
had
a
national
bank
of
large
capital
in
whose
hands
was
concentrated
the
controlling
monetary
and
financial
power
of
the
nationan
institution
wielding
almost
kingly
power
and
exerting
vast
influence
upon
all
the
operations
of
trade
and
upon
the
policy
of
the
government
itself
great
britain
had
an
enormous
public
debt
and
it
had
become
a
part
of
her
public
policy
to
regard
this
as
a
public
blessing
great
britain
had
also
a
restrictive
policy
which
placed
fetters
and
burdens
on
trade
and
trammeled
the
productive
industry
of
the
mass
of
the
nation
by
her
combined
system
of
policy
the
landlords
and
other
property
holders
were
protected
and
enriched
by
the
enormous
taxes
which
were
levied
upon
the
labor
of
the
country
for
their
advantage
imitating
this
foreign
policy
the
first
step
in
establishing
the
new
system
in
the
united
states
was
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
not
foreseeing
the
dangerous
power
and
countless
evils
which
such
an
institution
might
entail
on
the
country
nor
perceiving
the
connection
which
it
was
designed
to
form
between
the
bank
and
the
other
branches
of
the
miscalled
american
system
but
feeling
the
embarrassments
of
the
treasury
and
of
the
business
of
the
country
consequent
upon
the
war
some
of
our
statesmen
who
had
held
different
and
sounder
views
were
induced
to
yield
their
scruples
and
indeed
settled
convictions
of
its
unconstitutionality
and
to
give
it
their
sanction
as
an
expedient
which
they
vainly
hoped
might
produce
relief
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
error
as
the
subsequent
history
and
final
catastrophe
of
that
dangerous
and
corrupt
institution
have
abundantly
proved
the
bank
with
its
numerous
branches
ramified
into
the
states
soon
brought
many
of
the
active
political
and
commercial
men
in
different
sections
of
the
country
into
the
relation
of
debtors
to
it
and
dependents
upon
it
for
pecuniary
favors
thus
diffusing
throughout
the
mass
of
society
a
great
number
of
individuals
of
power
and
influence
to
give
tone
to
public
opinion
and
to
act
in
concert
in
cases
of
emergency
the
corrupt
power
of
such
a
political
engine
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
speculation
having
been
displayed
in
numerous
instances
but
most
signally
in
the
political
struggles
of
and
in
opposition
to
the
public
will
represented
by
a
fearless
and
patriotic
president
but
the
bank
was
but
one
branch
of
the
new
system
a
public
debt
of
more
than
existed
and
it
is
not
to
be
disguised
that
many
of
the
authors
of
the
new
system
did
not
regard
its
speedy
payment
as
essential
to
the
public
prosperity
but
looked
upon
its
continuance
as
no
national
evil
whilst
the
debt
existed
it
furnished
aliment
to
the
national
bank
and
rendered
increased
taxation
necessary
to
the
amount
of
the
interest
exceeding
annually
this
operated
in
harmony
with
the
next
branch
of
the
new
system
which
was
a
high
protective
tariff
this
was
to
afford
bounties
to
favored
classes
and
particular
pursuits
at
the
expense
of
all
others
a
proposition
to
tax
the
whole
people
for
the
purpose
of
enriching
a
few
was
too
monstrous
to
be
openly
made
the
scheme
was
therefore
veiled
under
the
plausible
but
delusive
pretext
of
a
measure
to
protect
home
industry
and
many
of
our
people
were
for
a
time
led
to
believe
that
a
tax
which
in
the
main
fell
upon
labor
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
laborer
who
paid
it
this
branch
of
the
system
involved
a
partnership
between
the
government
and
the
favored
classes
the
former
receiving
the
proceeds
of
the
tax
imposed
on
articles
imported
and
the
latter
the
increased
price
of
similar
articles
produced
at
home
caused
by
such
tax
it
is
obvious
that
the
portion
to
be
received
by
the
favored
classes
would
as
a
general
rule
be
increased
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
the
rates
of
tax
imposed
and
diminished
as
those
rates
were
reduced
to
the
revenue
standard
required
by
the
wants
of
the
government
the
rates
required
to
produce
a
sufficient
revenue
for
the
ordinary
expenditures
of
government
for
necessary
purposes
were
not
likely
to
give
to
the
private
partners
in
this
scheme
profits
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
cupidity
and
hence
a
variety
of
expedients
and
pretexts
were
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
enlarging
the
expenditures
and
thereby
creating
a
necessity
for
keeping
up
a
high
protective
tariff
the
effect
of
this
policy
was
to
interpose
artificial
restrictions
upon
the
natural
course
of
the
business
and
trade
of
the
country
and
to
advance
the
interests
of
large
capitalists
and
monopolists
at
the
expense
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
who
were
taxed
to
increase
their
wealth
another
branch
of
this
system
was
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
internal
improvements
capable
of
indefinite
enlargement
and
sufficient
to
swallow
up
as
many
millions
annually
as
could
be
exacted
from
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
country
this
was
a
convenient
and
necessary
adjunct
of
the
protective
tariff
it
was
to
be
the
great
absorbent
of
any
surplus
which
might
at
any
time
accumulate
in
the
treasury
and
of
the
taxes
levied
on
the
people
not
for
necessary
revenue
purposes
but
for
the
avowed
object
of
affording
protection
to
the
favored
classes
auxiliary
to
the
same
end
if
it
was
not
an
essential
part
of
the
system
itself
was
the
scheme
which
at
a
later
period
obtained
for
distributing
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
among
the
states
other
expedients
were
devised
to
take
money
out
of
the
treasury
and
prevent
its
coming
in
from
any
other
source
than
the
protective
tariff
the
authors
and
supporters
of
the
system
were
the
advocates
of
the
largest
expenditures
whether
for
necessary
or
useful
purposes
or
not
because
the
larger
the
expenditures
the
greater
was
the
pretext
for
high
taxes
in
the
form
of
protective
duties
these
several
measures
were
sustained
by
popular
names
and
plausible
arguments
by
which
thousands
were
deluded
the
bank
was
represented
to
be
an
indispensable
fiscal
agent
for
the
government
was
to
equalize
exchanges
and
to
regulate
and
furnish
a
sound
currency
always
and
everywhere
of
uniform
value
the
protective
tariff
was
to
give
employment
to
american
labor
at
advanced
prices
was
to
protect
home
industry
and
furnish
a
steady
market
for
the
farmer
internal
improvements
were
to
bring
trade
into
every
neighborhood
and
enhance
the
value
of
every
mans
property
the
distribution
of
the
land
money
was
to
enrich
the
states
finish
their
public
works
plant
schools
throughout
their
borders
and
relieve
them
from
taxation
but
the
fact
that
for
every
dollar
taken
out
of
the
treasury
for
these
objects
a
much
larger
sum
was
transferred
from
the
pockets
of
the
people
to
the
favored
classes
was
carefully
concealed
as
was
also
the
tendency
if
not
the
ultimate
design
of
the
system
to
build
up
an
aristocracy
of
wealth
to
control
the
masses
of
society
and
monopolize
the
political
power
of
the
country
the
several
branches
of
this
system
were
so
intimately
blended
together
that
in
their
operation
each
sustained
and
strengthened
the
others
their
joint
operation
was
to
add
new
burdens
of
taxation
and
to
encourage
a
largely
increased
and
wasteful
expenditure
of
public
money
it
was
the
interest
of
the
bank
that
the
revenue
collected
and
the
disbursements
made
by
the
government
should
be
large
because
being
the
depository
of
the
public
money
the
larger
the
amount
the
greater
would
be
the
bank
profits
by
its
use
it
was
the
interest
of
the
favored
classes
who
were
enriched
by
the
protective
tariff
to
have
the
rates
of
that
protection
as
high
as
possible
for
the
higher
those
rates
the
greater
would
be
their
advantage
it
was
the
interest
of
the
people
of
all
those
sections
and
localities
who
expected
to
be
benefited
by
expenditures
for
internal
improvements
that
the
amount
collected
should
be
as
large
as
possible
to
the
end
that
the
sum
disbursed
might
also
be
the
larger
the
states
being
the
beneficiaries
in
the
distribution
of
the
land
money
had
an
interest
in
having
the
rates
of
tax
imposed
by
the
protective
tariff
large
enough
to
yield
a
sufficient
revenue
from
that
source
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
government
without
disturbing
or
taking
from
them
the
land
fund
so
that
each
of
the
branches
constituting
the
system
had
a
common
interest
in
swelling
the
public
expenditures
they
had
a
direct
interest
in
maintaining
the
public
debt
unpaid
and
increasing
its
amount
because
this
would
produce
an
annual
increased
drain
upon
the
treasury
to
the
amount
of
the
interest
and
render
augmented
taxes
necessary
the
operation
and
necessary
effect
of
the
whole
system
were
to
encourage
large
and
extravagant
expenditures
and
thereby
to
increase
the
public
patronage
and
maintain
a
rich
and
splendid
government
at
the
expense
of
a
taxed
and
impoverished
people
it
is
manifest
that
this
scheme
of
enlarged
taxation
and
expenditures
had
it
continued
to
prevail
must
soon
have
converted
the
government
of
the
union
intended
by
its
framers
to
be
a
plain
cheap
and
simple
confederation
of
states
united
together
for
common
protection
and
charged
with
a
few
specific
duties
relating
chiefly
to
our
foreign
affairs
into
a
consolidated
empire
depriving
the
states
of
their
reserved
rights
and
the
people
of
their
just
power
and
control
in
the
administration
of
their
government
in
this
manner
the
whole
form
and
character
of
the
government
would
be
changed
not
by
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
but
by
resorting
to
an
unwarrantable
and
unauthorized
construction
of
that
instrument
the
indirect
mode
of
levying
the
taxes
by
a
duty
on
imports
prevents
the
mass
of
the
people
from
readily
perceiving
the
amount
they
pay
and
has
enabled
the
few
who
are
thus
enriched
and
who
seek
to
wield
the
political
power
of
the
country
to
deceive
and
delude
them
were
the
taxes
collected
by
a
direct
levy
upon
the
people
as
is
the
case
in
the
states
this
could
not
occur
the
whole
system
was
resisted
from
its
inception
by
many
of
our
ablest
statesmen
some
of
whom
doubted
its
constitutionality
and
its
expediency
while
others
believed
it
was
in
all
its
branches
a
flagrant
and
dangerous
infraction
of
the
constitution
that
a
national
bank
a
protective
tarifflevied
not
to
raise
the
revenue
needed
but
for
protection
merelyinternal
improvements
and
the
distribution
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
are
measures
without
the
warrant
of
the
constitution
would
upon
the
maturest
consideration
seem
to
be
clear
it
is
remarkable
that
no
one
of
these
measures
involving
such
momentous
consequences
is
authorized
by
any
express
grant
of
power
in
the
constitution
no
one
of
them
is
incident
to
as
being
necessary
and
proper
for
the
execution
of
the
specific
powers
granted
by
the
constitution
the
authority
under
which
it
has
been
attempted
to
justify
each
of
them
is
derived
from
inferences
and
constructions
of
the
constitution
which
its
letter
and
its
whole
object
and
design
do
not
warrant
is
it
to
be
conceived
that
such
immense
powers
would
have
been
left
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
mere
inferences
and
doubtful
constructions
had
it
been
intended
to
confer
them
on
the
federal
government
it
is
but
reasonable
to
conclude
that
it
would
have
been
done
by
plain
and
unequivocal
grants
this
was
not
done
but
the
whole
structure
of
which
the
american
system
consisted
was
reared
on
no
other
or
better
foundation
than
forced
implications
and
inferences
of
power
which
its
authors
assumed
might
be
deduced
by
construction
from
the
constitution
but
it
has
been
urged
that
the
national
bank
which
constituted
so
essential
a
branch
of
this
combined
system
of
measures
was
not
a
new
measure
and
that
its
constitutionality
had
been
previously
sanctioned
because
a
bank
had
been
chartered
in
and
had
received
the
official
signature
of
president
washington
a
few
facts
will
show
the
just
weight
to
which
this
precedent
should
be
entitled
as
bearing
upon
the
question
of
constitutionality
great
division
of
opinion
upon
the
subject
existed
in
congress
it
is
well
known
that
president
washington
entertained
serious
doubts
both
as
to
the
constitutionality
and
expediency
of
the
measure
and
while
the
bill
was
before
him
for
his
official
approval
or
disapproval
so
great
were
these
doubts
that
he
required
the
opinion
in
writing
of
the
members
of
his
cabinet
to
aid
him
in
arriving
at
a
decision
his
cabinet
gave
their
opinions
and
were
divided
upon
the
subject
general
hamilton
being
in
favor
of
and
mr
jefferson
and
mr
randolph
being
opposed
to
the
constitutionality
and
expediency
of
the
bank
it
is
well
known
also
that
president
washington
retained
the
bill
from
monday
the
th
when
it
was
presented
to
him
until
friday
the
th
of
february
being
the
last
moment
permitted
him
by
the
constitution
to
deliberate
when
he
finally
yielded
to
it
his
reluctant
assent
and
gave
it
his
signature
it
is
certain
that
as
late
as
the
d
of
february
being
the
ninth
day
after
the
bill
was
presented
to
him
he
had
arrived
at
no
satisfactory
conclusion
for
on
that
day
he
addressed
a
note
to
general
hamilton
in
which
he
informs
him
that
this
bill
was
presented
to
me
by
the
joint
committee
of
congress
at
oclock
on
monday
the
th
instant
and
he
requested
his
opinion
to
what
precise
period
by
legal
interpretation
of
the
constitution
can
the
president
retain
it
in
his
possession
before
it
becomes
a
law
by
the
lapse
of
ten
days
if
the
proper
construction
was
that
the
day
on
which
the
bill
was
presented
to
the
president
and
the
day
on
which
his
action
was
had
upon
it
were
both
to
be
counted
inclusive
then
the
time
allowed
him
within
which
it
would
be
competent
for
him
to
return
it
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
his
objections
would
expire
on
thursday
the
th
of
february
general
hamilton
on
the
same
day
returned
an
answer
in
which
he
states
i
give
it
as
my
opinion
that
you
have
ten
days
exclusive
of
that
on
which
the
bill
was
delivered
to
you
and
sundays
hence
in
the
present
case
if
it
is
returned
on
friday
it
will
be
in
time
by
this
construction
which
the
president
adopted
he
gained
another
day
for
deliberation
and
it
was
not
until
the
th
of
february
that
he
signed
the
bill
thus
affording
conclusive
proof
that
he
had
at
last
obtained
his
own
consent
to
sign
it
not
without
great
and
almost
insuperable
difficulty
additional
light
has
been
recently
shed
upon
the
serious
doubts
which
he
had
on
the
subject
amounting
at
one
time
to
a
conviction
that
it
was
his
duty
to
withhold
his
approval
from
the
bill
this
is
found
among
the
manuscript
papers
of
mr
madison
authorized
to
be
purchased
for
the
use
of
the
government
by
an
act
of
the
last
session
of
congress
and
now
for
the
first
time
accessible
to
the
public
from
these
papers
it
appears
that
president
washington
while
he
yet
held
the
bank
bill
in
his
hands
actually
requested
mr
madison
at
that
time
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
prepare
the
draft
of
a
veto
message
for
him
mr
madison
at
his
request
did
prepare
the
draft
of
such
a
message
and
sent
it
to
him
on
the
st
of
february
a
copy
of
this
original
draft
in
mr
madisons
own
handwriting
was
carefully
preserved
by
him
and
is
among
the
papers
lately
purchased
by
congress
it
is
preceded
by
a
note
written
on
the
same
sheet
which
is
also
in
mr
madisons
handwriting
and
is
as
follows
february
copy
of
a
paper
made
out
and
sent
to
the
president
at
his
request
to
be
ready
in
case
his
judgment
should
finally
decide
against
the
bill
for
incorporating
a
national
bank
the
bill
being
then
before
him
among
the
objections
assigned
in
this
paper
to
the
bill
and
which
were
submitted
for
the
consideration
of
the
president
are
the
following
i
object
to
the
bill
because
it
is
an
essential
principle
of
the
government
that
powers
not
delegated
by
the
constitution
can
not
be
rightfully
exercised
because
the
power
proposed
by
the
bill
to
be
exercised
is
not
expressly
delegated
and
because
i
can
not
satisfy
myself
that
it
results
from
any
express
power
by
fair
and
safe
rules
of
interpretation
the
weight
of
the
precedent
of
the
bank
of
and
the
sanction
of
the
great
name
of
washington
which
has
been
so
often
invoked
in
its
support
are
greatly
weakened
by
the
development
of
these
facts
the
experiment
of
that
bank
satisfied
the
country
that
it
ought
not
to
be
continued
and
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
congress
refused
to
recharter
it
it
would
have
been
fortunate
for
the
country
and
saved
thousands
from
bankruptcy
and
ruin
had
our
public
men
of
resisted
the
temporary
pressure
of
the
times
upon
our
financial
and
pecuniary
interests
and
refused
to
charter
the
second
bank
of
this
the
country
became
abundantly
satisfied
and
at
the
close
of
its
twenty
years
duration
as
in
the
case
of
the
first
bank
it
also
ceased
to
exist
under
the
repeated
blows
of
president
jackson
it
reeled
and
fell
and
a
subsequent
attempt
to
charter
a
similar
institution
was
arrested
by
the
veto
of
president
tyler
mr
madison
in
yielding
his
signature
to
the
charter
of
did
so
upon
the
ground
of
the
respect
due
to
precedents
and
as
he
subsequently
declared
the
bank
of
the
united
states
though
on
the
original
question
held
to
be
unconstitutional
received
the
executive
signature
it
is
probable
that
neither
the
bank
of
nor
that
of
would
have
been
chartered
but
for
the
embarrassments
of
the
government
in
its
finances
the
derangement
of
the
currency
and
the
pecuniary
pressure
which
existed
the
first
the
consequence
of
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
the
second
the
consequence
of
the
war
of
both
were
resorted
to
in
the
delusive
hope
that
they
would
restore
public
credit
and
afford
relief
to
the
government
and
to
the
business
of
the
country
those
of
our
public
men
who
opposed
the
whole
american
system
at
its
commencement
and
throughout
its
progress
foresaw
and
predicted
that
it
was
fraught
with
incalculable
mischiefs
and
must
result
in
serious
injury
to
the
best
interests
of
the
country
for
a
series
of
years
their
wise
counsels
were
unheeded
and
the
system
was
established
it
was
soon
apparent
that
its
practical
operation
was
unequal
and
unjust
upon
different
portions
of
the
country
and
upon
the
people
engaged
in
different
pursuits
all
were
equally
entitled
to
the
favor
and
protection
of
the
government
it
fostered
and
elevated
the
money
power
and
enriched
the
favored
few
by
taxing
labor
and
at
the
expense
of
the
many
its
effect
was
to
make
the
rich
richer
and
the
poor
poorer
its
tendency
was
to
create
distinctions
in
society
based
on
wealth
and
to
give
to
the
favored
classes
undue
control
and
sway
in
our
government
it
was
an
organized
money
power
which
resisted
the
popular
will
and
sought
to
shape
and
control
the
public
policy
under
the
pernicious
workings
of
this
combined
system
of
measures
the
country
witnessed
alternate
seasons
of
temporary
apparent
prosperity
of
sudden
and
disastrous
commercial
revulsions
of
unprecedented
fluctuation
of
prices
and
depression
of
the
great
interests
of
agriculture
navigation
and
commerce
of
general
pecuniary
suffering
and
of
final
bankruptcy
of
thousands
after
a
severe
struggle
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
system
was
overthrown
the
bank
has
been
succeeded
by
a
practical
system
of
finance
conducted
and
controlled
solely
by
the
government
the
constitutional
currency
has
been
restored
the
public
credit
maintained
unimpaired
even
in
a
period
of
a
foreign
war
and
the
whole
country
has
become
satisfied
that
banks
national
or
state
are
not
necessary
as
fiscal
agents
of
the
government
revenue
duties
have
taken
the
place
of
the
protective
tariff
the
distribution
of
the
money
derived
from
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
has
been
abandoned
and
the
corrupting
system
of
internal
improvements
it
is
hoped
has
been
effectually
checked
it
is
not
doubted
that
if
this
whole
train
of
measures
designed
to
take
wealth
from
the
many
and
bestow
it
upon
the
few
were
to
prevail
the
effect
would
be
to
change
the
entire
character
of
the
government
one
only
danger
remains
it
is
the
seductions
of
that
branch
of
the
system
which
consists
in
internal
improvements
holding
out
as
it
does
inducements
to
the
people
of
particular
sections
and
localities
to
embark
the
government
in
them
without
stopping
to
calculate
the
inevitable
consequences
this
branch
of
the
system
is
so
intimately
combined
and
linked
with
the
others
that
as
surely
as
an
effect
is
produced
by
an
adequate
cause
if
it
be
resuscitated
and
revived
and
firmly
established
it
requires
no
sagacity
to
foresee
that
it
will
necessarily
and
speedily
draw
after
it
the
reestablishment
of
a
national
bank
the
revival
of
a
protective
tariff
the
distribution
of
the
land
money
and
not
only
the
postponement
to
the
distant
future
of
the
payment
of
the
present
national
debt
but
its
annual
increase
i
entertain
the
solemn
conviction
that
if
the
internalimprovement
branch
of
the
american
system
be
not
firmly
resisted
at
this
time
the
whole
series
of
measures
composing
it
will
be
speedily
reestablished
and
the
country
be
thrown
back
from
its
present
high
state
of
prosperity
which
the
existing
policy
has
produced
and
be
destined
again
to
witness
all
the
evils
commercial
revulsions
depression
of
prices
and
pecuniary
embarrassments
through
which
we
have
passed
during
the
last
twentyfive
years
to
guard
against
consequences
so
ruinous
is
an
object
of
high
national
importance
involving
in
my
judgment
the
continued
prosperity
of
the
country
i
have
felt
it
to
be
an
imperative
obligation
to
withhold
my
constitutional
sanction
from
two
bills
which
had
passed
the
two
houses
of
congress
involving
the
principle
of
the
internal
improvement
branch
of
the
american
system
and
conflicting
in
their
provisions
with
the
views
here
expressed
this
power
conferred
upon
the
president
by
the
constitution
i
have
on
three
occasions
during
my
administration
of
the
executive
department
of
the
government
deemed
it
my
duty
to
exercise
and
on
this
last
occasion
of
making
to
congress
an
annual
communication
of
the
state
of
the
union
it
is
not
deemed
inappropriate
to
review
the
principles
and
considerations
which
have
governed
my
action
i
deem
this
the
more
necessary
because
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
sixty
years
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
this
undoubted
constitutional
power
by
the
president
has
for
the
first
time
been
drawn
seriously
in
question
by
a
portion
of
my
fellowcitizens
the
constitution
provides
that
every
bill
which
shall
have
passed
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
shall
before
it
become
a
law
be
presented
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
if
he
approve
he
shall
sign
it
but
if
not
he
shall
return
it
with
his
objections
to
that
house
in
which
it
shall
have
originated
who
shall
enter
the
objections
at
large
on
their
journal
and
proceed
to
reconsider
it
the
preservation
of
the
constitution
from
infraction
is
the
presidents
highest
duty
he
is
bound
to
discharge
that
duty
at
whatever
hazard
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
those
who
may
differ
with
him
in
opinion
he
is
bound
to
discharge
it
as
well
by
his
obligations
to
the
people
who
have
clothed
him
with
his
exalted
trust
as
by
his
oath
of
office
which
he
may
not
disregard
nor
are
the
obligations
of
the
president
in
any
degree
lessened
by
the
prevalence
of
views
different
from
his
own
in
one
or
both
houses
of
congress
it
is
not
alone
hasty
and
inconsiderate
legislation
that
he
is
required
to
check
but
if
at
any
time
congress
shall
after
apparently
full
deliberation
resolve
on
measures
which
he
deems
subversive
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
vital
interests
of
the
country
it
is
his
solemn
duty
to
stand
in
the
breach
and
resist
them
the
president
is
bound
to
approve
or
disapprove
every
bill
which
passes
congress
and
is
presented
to
him
for
his
signature
the
constitution
makes
this
his
duty
and
he
can
not
escape
it
if
he
would
he
has
no
election
in
deciding
upon
any
bill
presented
to
him
he
must
exercise
his
own
best
judgment
if
he
can
not
approve
the
constitution
commands
him
to
return
the
bill
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
his
objections
and
if
he
fail
to
do
this
within
ten
days
sundays
excepted
it
shall
become
a
law
without
his
signature
right
or
wrong
he
may
be
overruled
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
each
house
and
in
that
event
the
bill
becomes
a
law
without
his
sanction
if
his
objections
be
not
thus
overruled
the
subject
is
only
postponed
and
is
referred
to
the
states
and
the
people
for
their
consideration
and
decision
the
presidents
power
is
negative
merely
and
not
affirmative
he
can
enact
no
law
the
only
effect
therefore
of
his
withholding
his
approval
of
a
bill
passed
by
congress
is
to
suffer
the
existing
laws
to
remain
unchanged
and
the
delay
occasioned
is
only
that
required
to
enable
the
states
and
the
people
to
consider
and
act
upon
the
subject
in
the
election
of
public
agents
who
will
carry
out
their
wishes
and
instructions
any
attempt
to
coerce
the
president
to
yield
his
sanction
to
measures
which
he
can
not
approve
would
be
a
violation
of
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
palpable
and
flagrant
and
if
successful
would
break
down
the
independence
of
the
executive
department
and
make
the
president
elected
by
the
people
and
clothed
by
the
constitution
with
power
to
defend
their
rights
the
mere
instrument
of
a
majority
of
congress
a
surrender
on
his
part
of
the
powers
with
which
the
constitution
has
invested
his
office
would
effect
a
practical
alteration
of
that
instrument
without
resorting
to
the
prescribed
process
of
amendment
with
the
motives
or
considerations
which
may
induce
congress
to
pass
any
bill
the
president
can
have
nothing
to
do
he
must
presume
them
to
be
as
pure
as
his
own
and
look
only
to
the
practical
effect
of
their
measures
when
compared
with
the
constitution
or
the
public
good
but
it
has
been
urged
by
those
who
object
to
the
exercise
of
this
undoubted
constitutional
power
that
it
assails
the
representative
principle
and
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
that
there
is
greater
safety
in
a
numerous
representative
body
than
in
the
single
executive
created
by
the
constitution
and
that
the
executive
veto
is
a
oneman
power
despotic
in
its
character
to
expose
the
fallacy
of
this
objection
it
is
only
necessary
to
consider
the
frame
and
true
character
of
our
system
ours
is
not
a
consolidated
empire
but
a
confederated
union
the
states
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
were
coordinate
coequal
and
separate
independent
sovereignties
and
by
its
adoption
they
did
not
lose
that
character
they
clothed
the
federal
government
with
certain
powers
and
reserved
all
others
including
their
own
sovereignty
to
themselves
they
guarded
their
own
rights
as
states
and
the
rights
of
the
people
by
the
very
limitations
which
they
incorporated
into
the
federal
constitution
whereby
the
different
departments
of
the
general
government
were
checks
upon
each
other
that
the
majority
should
govern
is
a
general
principle
controverted
by
none
but
they
must
govern
according
to
the
constitution
and
not
according
to
an
undefined
and
unrestrained
discretion
whereby
they
may
oppress
the
minority
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
they
may
be
temporarily
misled
and
that
their
representatives
legislative
and
executive
may
be
mistaken
or
influenced
in
their
action
by
improper
motives
they
have
therefore
interposed
between
themselves
and
the
laws
which
may
be
passed
by
their
public
agents
various
representations
such
as
assemblies
senates
and
governors
in
their
several
states
a
house
of
representatives
a
senate
and
a
president
of
the
united
states
the
people
can
by
their
own
direct
agency
make
no
law
nor
can
the
house
of
representatives
immediately
elected
by
them
nor
can
the
senate
nor
can
both
together
without
the
concurrence
of
the
president
or
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
happily
for
themselves
the
people
in
framing
our
admirable
system
of
government
were
conscious
of
the
infirmities
of
their
representatives
and
in
delegating
to
them
the
power
of
legislation
they
have
fenced
them
around
with
checks
to
guard
against
the
effects
of
hasty
action
of
error
of
combination
and
of
possible
corruption
error
selfishness
and
faction
have
often
sought
to
rend
asunder
this
web
of
checks
and
subject
the
government
to
the
control
of
fanatic
and
sinister
influences
but
these
efforts
have
only
satisfied
the
people
of
the
wisdom
of
the
checks
which
they
have
imposed
and
of
the
necessity
of
preserving
them
unimpaired
the
true
theory
of
our
system
is
not
to
govern
by
the
acts
or
decrees
of
any
one
set
of
representatives
the
constitution
interposes
checks
upon
all
branches
of
the
government
in
order
to
give
time
for
error
to
be
corrected
and
delusion
to
pass
away
but
if
the
people
settle
down
into
a
firm
conviction
different
from
that
of
their
representatives
they
give
effect
to
their
opinions
by
changing
their
public
servants
the
checks
which
the
people
imposed
on
their
public
servants
in
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
are
the
best
evidence
of
their
capacity
for
selfgovernment
they
know
that
the
men
whom
they
elect
to
public
stations
are
of
like
infirmities
and
passions
with
themselves
and
not
to
be
trusted
without
being
restricted
by
coordinate
authorities
and
constitutional
limitations
who
that
has
witnessed
the
legislation
of
congress
for
the
last
thirty
years
will
say
that
he
knows
of
no
instance
in
which
measures
not
demanded
by
the
public
good
have
been
carried
who
will
deny
that
in
the
state
governments
by
combinations
of
individuals
and
sections
in
derogation
of
the
general
interest
banks
have
been
chartered
systems
of
internal
improvements
adopted
and
debts
entailed
upon
the
people
repressing
their
growth
and
impairing
their
energies
for
years
to
come
after
so
much
experience
it
can
not
be
said
that
absolute
unchecked
power
is
safe
in
the
hands
of
any
one
set
of
representatives
or
that
the
capacity
of
the
people
for
selfgovernment
which
is
admitted
in
its
broadest
extent
is
a
conclusive
argument
to
prove
the
prudence
wisdom
and
integrity
of
their
representatives
the
people
by
the
constitution
have
commanded
the
president
as
much
as
they
have
commanded
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
to
execute
their
will
they
have
said
to
him
in
the
constitution
which
they
require
he
shall
take
a
solemn
oath
to
support
that
if
congress
pass
any
bill
which
he
can
not
approve
he
shall
return
it
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
his
objections
in
withholding
from
it
his
approval
and
signature
he
is
executing
the
will
of
the
people
constitutionally
expressed
as
much
as
the
congress
that
passed
it
no
bill
is
presumed
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
popular
will
until
it
shall
have
passed
through
all
the
branches
of
the
government
required
by
the
constitution
to
make
it
a
law
a
bill
which
passes
the
house
of
representatives
may
be
rejected
by
the
senate
and
so
a
bill
passed
by
the
senate
may
be
rejected
by
the
house
in
each
case
the
respective
houses
exercise
the
veto
power
on
the
other
congress
and
each
house
of
congress
hold
under
the
constitution
a
check
upon
the
president
and
he
by
the
power
of
the
qualified
veto
a
check
upon
congress
when
the
president
recommends
measures
to
congress
he
avows
in
the
most
solemn
form
his
opinions
gives
his
voice
in
their
favor
and
pledges
himself
in
advance
to
approve
them
if
passed
by
congress
if
he
acts
without
due
consideration
or
has
been
influenced
by
improper
or
corrupt
motives
or
if
from
any
other
cause
congress
or
either
house
of
congress
shall
differ
with
him
in
opinion
they
exercise
their
veto
upon
his
recommendations
and
reject
them
and
there
is
no
appeal
from
their
decision
but
to
the
people
at
the
ballot
box
these
are
proper
checks
upon
the
executive
wisely
interposed
by
the
constitution
none
will
be
found
to
object
to
them
or
to
wish
them
removed
it
is
equally
important
that
the
constitutional
checks
of
the
executive
upon
the
legislative
branch
should
be
preserved
if
it
be
said
that
the
representatives
in
the
popular
branch
of
congress
are
chosen
directly
by
the
people
it
is
answered
the
people
elect
the
president
if
both
houses
represent
the
states
and
the
people
so
does
the
president
the
president
represents
in
the
executive
department
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
as
each
member
of
the
legislative
department
represents
portions
of
them
the
doctrine
of
restriction
upon
legislative
and
executive
power
while
a
wellsettled
public
opinion
is
enabled
within
a
reasonable
time
to
accomplish
its
ends
has
made
our
country
what
it
is
and
has
opened
to
us
a
career
of
glory
and
happiness
to
which
all
other
nations
have
been
strangers
in
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
veto
the
president
is
responsible
not
only
to
an
enlightened
public
opinion
but
to
the
people
of
the
whole
union
who
elected
him
as
the
representatives
in
the
legislative
branches
who
differ
with
him
in
opinion
are
responsible
to
the
people
of
particular
states
or
districts
who
compose
their
respective
constituencies
to
deny
to
the
president
the
exercise
of
this
power
would
be
to
repeal
that
provision
of
the
constitution
which
confers
it
upon
him
to
charge
that
its
exercise
unduly
controls
the
legislative
will
is
to
complain
of
the
constitution
itself
if
the
presidential
veto
be
objected
to
upon
the
ground
that
it
checks
and
thwarts
the
popular
will
upon
the
same
principle
the
equality
of
representation
of
the
states
in
the
senate
should
be
stricken
out
of
the
constitution
the
vote
of
a
senator
from
delaware
has
equal
weight
in
deciding
upon
the
most
important
measures
with
the
vote
of
a
senator
from
new
york
and
yet
the
one
represents
a
state
containing
according
to
the
existing
apportionment
of
representatives
in
the
house
of
representatives
but
one
thirtyfourth
part
of
the
population
of
the
other
by
the
constitutional
composition
of
the
senate
a
majority
of
that
body
from
the
smaller
states
represent
less
than
onefourth
of
the
people
of
the
union
there
are
thirty
states
and
under
the
existing
apportionment
of
representatives
there
are
members
in
the
house
of
representatives
sixteen
of
the
smaller
states
are
represented
in
that
house
by
but
members
and
yet
the
senators
from
these
states
constitute
a
majority
of
the
senate
so
that
the
president
may
recommend
a
measure
to
congress
and
it
may
receive
the
sanction
and
approval
of
more
than
threefourths
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
all
the
senators
from
the
large
states
containing
more
than
threefourths
of
the
whole
population
of
the
united
states
and
yet
the
measure
may
be
defeated
by
the
votes
of
the
senators
from
the
smaller
states
none
it
is
presumed
can
be
found
ready
to
change
the
organization
of
the
senate
on
this
account
or
to
strike
that
body
practically
out
of
existence
by
requiring
that
its
action
shall
be
conformed
to
the
will
of
the
more
numerous
branch
upon
the
same
principle
that
the
veto
of
the
president
should
be
practically
abolished
the
power
of
the
vicepresident
to
give
the
casting
vote
upon
an
equal
division
of
the
senate
should
be
abolished
also
the
vicepresident
exercises
the
veto
power
as
effectually
by
rejecting
a
bill
by
his
casting
vote
as
the
president
does
by
refusing
to
approve
and
sign
it
this
power
has
been
exercised
by
the
vicepresident
in
a
few
instances
the
most
important
of
which
was
the
rejection
of
the
bill
to
recharter
the
bank
of
the
united
states
in
it
may
happen
that
a
bill
may
be
passed
by
a
large
majority
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
may
be
supported
by
the
senators
from
the
larger
states
and
the
vicepresident
may
reject
it
by
giving
his
vote
with
the
senators
from
the
smaller
states
and
yet
none
it
is
presumed
are
prepared
to
deny
to
him
the
exercise
of
this
power
under
the
constitution
but
it
is
in
point
of
fact
untrue
that
an
act
passed
by
congress
is
conclusive
evidence
that
it
is
an
emanation
of
the
popular
will
a
majority
of
the
whole
number
elected
to
each
house
of
congress
constitutes
a
quorum
and
a
majority
of
that
quorum
is
competent
to
pass
laws
it
might
happen
that
a
quorum
of
the
house
of
representatives
consisting
of
a
single
member
more
than
half
of
the
whole
number
elected
to
that
house
might
pass
a
bill
by
a
majority
of
a
single
vote
and
in
that
case
a
fraction
more
than
onefourth
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
be
represented
by
those
who
voted
for
it
it
might
happen
that
the
same
bill
might
be
passed
by
a
majority
of
one
of
a
quorum
of
the
senate
composed
of
senators
from
the
fifteen
smaller
states
and
a
single
senator
from
a
sixteenth
state
and
if
the
senators
voting
for
it
happened
to
be
from
the
eight
of
the
smallest
of
these
states
it
would
be
passed
by
the
votes
of
senators
from
states
having
but
fourteen
representatives
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
containing
less
than
onesixteenth
of
the
whole
population
of
the
united
states
this
extreme
case
is
stated
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
the
mere
passage
of
a
bill
by
congress
is
no
conclusive
evidence
that
those
who
passed
it
represent
the
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
or
truly
reflect
their
will
if
such
an
extreme
case
is
not
likely
to
happen
cases
that
approximate
it
are
of
constant
occurrence
it
is
believed
that
not
a
single
law
has
been
passed
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
upon
which
all
the
members
elected
to
both
houses
have
been
present
and
voted
many
of
the
most
important
acts
which
have
passed
congress
have
been
carried
by
a
close
vote
in
thin
houses
many
instances
of
this
might
be
given
indeed
our
experience
proves
that
many
of
the
most
important
acts
of
congress
are
postponed
to
the
last
days
and
often
the
last
hours
of
a
session
when
they
are
disposed
of
in
haste
and
by
houses
but
little
exceeding
the
number
necessary
to
form
a
quorum
besides
in
most
of
the
states
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
are
chosen
by
pluralities
and
not
by
majorities
of
all
the
voters
in
their
respective
districts
and
it
may
happen
that
a
majority
of
that
house
may
be
returned
by
a
less
aggregate
vote
of
the
people
than
that
received
by
the
minority
if
the
principle
insisted
on
be
sound
then
the
constitution
should
be
so
changed
that
no
bill
shall
become
a
law
unless
it
is
voted
for
by
members
representing
in
each
house
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
we
must
remodel
our
whole
system
strike
down
and
abolish
not
only
the
salutary
checks
lodged
in
the
executive
branch
but
must
strike
out
and
abolish
those
lodged
in
the
senate
also
and
thus
practically
invest
the
whole
power
of
the
government
in
a
majority
of
a
single
assemblya
majority
uncontrolled
and
absolute
and
which
may
become
despotic
to
conform
to
this
doctrine
of
the
right
of
majorities
to
rule
independent
of
the
checks
and
limitations
of
the
constitution
we
must
revolutionize
our
whole
system
we
must
destroy
the
constitutional
compact
by
which
the
several
states
agreed
to
form
a
federal
union
and
rush
into
consolidation
which
must
end
in
monarchy
or
despotism
no
one
advocates
such
a
proposition
and
yet
the
doctrine
maintained
if
carried
out
must
lead
to
this
result
one
great
object
of
the
constitution
in
conferring
upon
the
president
a
qualified
negative
upon
the
legislation
of
congress
was
to
protect
minorities
from
injustice
and
oppression
by
majorities
the
equality
of
their
representation
in
the
senate
and
the
veto
power
of
the
president
are
the
constitutional
guaranties
which
the
smaller
states
have
that
their
rights
will
be
respected
without
these
guaranties
all
their
interests
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
majorities
in
congress
representing
the
larger
states
to
the
smaller
and
weaker
states
therefore
the
preservation
of
this
power
and
its
exercise
upon
proper
occasions
demanding
it
is
of
vital
importance
they
ratified
the
constitution
and
entered
into
the
union
securing
to
themselves
an
equal
representation
with
the
larger
states
in
the
senate
and
they
agreed
to
be
bound
by
all
laws
passed
by
congress
upon
the
express
condition
and
none
other
that
they
should
be
approved
by
the
president
or
passed
his
objections
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
upon
this
condition
they
have
a
right
to
insist
as
a
part
of
the
compact
to
which
they
gave
their
assent
a
bill
might
be
passed
by
congress
against
the
will
of
the
whole
people
of
a
particular
state
and
against
the
votes
of
its
senators
and
all
its
representatives
however
prejudicial
it
might
be
to
the
interests
of
such
state
it
would
be
bound
by
it
if
the
president
shall
approve
it
or
it
shall
be
passed
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
but
it
has
a
right
to
demand
that
the
president
shall
exercise
his
constitutional
power
and
arrest
it
if
his
judgment
is
against
it
if
he
surrender
this
power
or
fail
to
exercise
it
in
a
case
where
he
can
not
approve
it
would
make
his
formal
approval
a
mere
mockery
and
would
be
itself
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
dissenting
state
would
become
bound
by
a
law
which
had
not
been
passed
according
to
the
sanctions
of
the
constitution
the
objection
to
the
exercise
of
the
veto
power
is
founded
upon
an
idea
respecting
the
popular
will
which
if
carried
out
would
annihilate
state
sovereignty
and
substitute
for
the
present
federal
government
a
consolidation
directed
by
a
supposed
numerical
majority
a
revolution
of
the
government
would
be
silently
effected
and
the
states
would
be
subjected
to
laws
to
which
they
had
never
given
their
constitutional
consent
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
invested
with
the
power
to
declare
and
has
declared
acts
of
congress
passed
with
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
approval
of
the
president
to
be
unconstitutional
and
void
and
yet
none
it
is
presumed
can
be
found
who
will
be
disposed
to
strip
this
highest
judicial
tribunal
under
the
constitution
of
this
acknowledged
powera
power
necessary
alike
to
its
independence
and
the
rights
of
individuals
for
the
same
reason
that
the
executive
veto
should
according
to
the
doctrine
maintained
be
rendered
nugatory
and
be
practically
expunged
from
the
constitution
this
power
of
the
court
should
also
be
rendered
nugatory
and
be
expunged
because
it
restrains
the
legislative
and
executive
will
and
because
the
exercise
of
such
a
power
by
the
court
may
be
regarded
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
indeed
there
is
more
reason
for
striking
this
power
of
the
court
from
the
constitution
than
there
is
that
of
the
qualified
veto
of
the
president
because
the
decision
of
the
court
is
final
and
can
never
be
reversed
even
though
both
houses
of
congress
and
the
president
should
be
unanimous
in
opposition
to
it
whereas
the
veto
of
the
president
may
be
overruled
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
of
congress
or
by
the
people
at
the
polls
it
is
obvious
that
to
preserve
the
system
established
by
the
constitution
each
of
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
governmentthe
executive
legislative
and
judicialmust
be
left
in
the
exercise
of
its
appropriate
powers
if
the
executive
or
the
judicial
branch
be
deprived
of
powers
conferred
upon
either
as
checks
on
the
legislative
the
preponderance
of
the
latter
will
become
disproportionate
and
absorbing
and
the
others
impotent
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
great
objects
for
which
they
were
established
organized
as
they
are
by
the
constitution
they
work
together
harmoniously
for
the
public
good
if
the
executive
and
the
judiciary
shall
be
deprived
of
the
constitutional
powers
invested
in
them
and
of
their
due
proportions
the
equilibrium
of
the
system
must
be
destroyed
and
consolidation
with
the
most
pernicious
results
must
ensuea
consolidation
of
unchecked
despotic
power
exercised
by
majorities
of
the
legislative
branch
the
executive
legislative
and
judicial
each
constitutes
a
separate
coordinate
department
of
the
government
and
each
is
independent
of
the
others
in
the
performance
of
their
respective
duties
under
the
constitution
neither
can
in
its
legitimate
action
control
the
others
they
each
act
upon
their
several
responsibilities
in
their
respective
spheres
but
if
the
doctrines
now
maintained
be
correct
the
executive
must
become
practically
subordinate
to
the
legislative
and
the
judiciary
must
become
subordinate
to
both
the
legislative
and
the
executive
and
thus
the
whole
power
of
the
government
would
be
merged
in
a
single
department
whenever
if
ever
this
shall
occur
our
glorious
system
of
wellregulated
selfgovernment
will
crumble
into
ruins
to
be
succeeded
first
by
anarchy
and
finally
by
monarchy
or
despotism
i
am
far
from
believing
that
this
doctrine
is
the
sentiment
of
the
american
people
and
during
the
short
period
which
remains
in
which
it
will
be
my
duty
to
administer
the
executive
department
it
will
be
my
aim
to
maintain
its
independence
and
discharge
its
duties
without
infringing
upon
the
powers
or
duties
of
either
of
the
other
departments
of
the
government
the
power
of
the
executive
veto
was
exercised
by
the
first
and
most
illustrious
of
my
predecessors
and
by
four
of
his
successors
who
preceded
me
in
the
administration
of
the
government
and
it
is
believed
in
no
instance
prejudicially
to
the
public
interests
it
has
never
been
and
there
is
but
little
danger
that
it
ever
can
be
abused
no
president
will
ever
desire
unnecessarily
to
place
his
opinion
in
opposition
to
that
of
congress
he
must
always
exercise
the
power
reluctantly
and
only
in
cases
where
his
convictions
make
it
a
matter
of
stern
duty
which
he
can
not
escape
indeed
there
is
more
danger
that
the
president
from
the
repugnance
he
must
always
feel
to
come
in
collision
with
congress
may
fail
to
exercise
it
in
cases
where
the
preservation
of
the
constitution
from
infraction
or
the
public
good
may
demand
it
than
that
he
will
ever
exercise
it
unnecessarily
or
wantonly
during
the
period
i
have
administered
the
executive
department
of
the
government
great
and
important
questions
of
public
policy
foreign
and
domestic
have
arisen
upon
which
it
was
my
duty
to
act
it
may
indeed
be
truly
said
that
my
administration
has
fallen
upon
eventful
times
i
have
felt
most
sensibly
the
weight
of
the
high
responsibilities
devolved
upon
me
with
no
other
object
than
the
public
good
the
enduring
fame
and
permanent
prosperity
of
my
country
i
have
pursued
the
convictions
of
my
own
best
judgment
the
impartial
arbitrament
of
enlightened
public
opinion
present
and
future
will
determine
how
far
the
public
policy
i
have
maintained
and
the
measures
i
have
from
time
to
time
recommended
may
have
tended
to
advance
or
retard
the
public
prosperity
at
home
and
to
elevate
or
depress
the
estimate
of
our
national
character
abroad
invoking
the
blessings
of
the
almighty
upon
your
deliberations
at
your
present
important
session
my
ardent
hope
is
that
in
a
spirit
of
harmony
and
concord
you
may
be
guided
to
wise
results
and
such
as
may
redound
to
the
happiness
the
honor
and
the
glory
of
our
beloved
country
