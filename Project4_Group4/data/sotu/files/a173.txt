to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
once
again
it
is
my
constitutional
duty
to
assess
the
state
of
the
union
on
each
such
previous
occasion
during
these
past
eight
years
i
have
outlined
a
forward
course
designed
to
achieve
our
mutual
objectivea
better
america
in
a
world
of
peace
this
time
my
function
is
different
the
american
people
in
free
election
have
selected
new
leadership
which
soon
will
be
entrusted
with
the
management
of
our
government
a
new
president
shortly
will
lay
before
you
his
proposals
to
shape
the
future
of
our
great
land
to
him
every
citizen
whatever
his
political
beliefs
prayerfully
extends
best
wishes
for
good
health
and
for
wisdom
and
success
in
coping
with
the
problems
that
confront
our
nation
for
my
part
i
should
like
first
to
express
to
you
of
the
congress
my
appreciation
of
your
devotion
to
the
common
good
and
your
friendship
over
these
difficult
years
i
will
carry
with
me
pleasant
memories
of
this
association
in
endeavors
profoundly
significant
to
all
our
people
we
have
been
through
a
lengthy
period
in
which
the
control
over
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
government
has
been
divided
between
our
two
great
political
parties
differences
of
course
we
have
had
particularly
in
domestic
affairs
but
in
a
united
determination
to
keep
this
nation
strong
and
free
and
to
utilize
our
vast
resources
for
the
advancement
of
all
mankind
we
have
carried
america
to
unprecedented
heights
for
this
cooperative
achievement
i
thank
the
american
people
and
those
in
the
congress
of
both
parties
who
have
supported
programs
in
the
interest
of
our
country
i
should
also
like
to
give
special
thanks
for
the
devoted
service
of
my
associates
in
the
executive
branch
and
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
career
employees
who
have
implemented
our
diverse
government
programs
my
second
purpose
is
to
review
briefly
the
record
of
these
past
eight
years
in
the
hope
that
out
of
the
sum
of
these
experiences
lessons
will
emerge
that
are
useful
to
our
nation
supporting
this
review
are
detailed
reports
from
the
several
agencies
and
departments
all
of
which
are
now
or
will
shortly
be
available
to
the
congress
throughout
the
world
the
years
since
have
been
a
period
of
profound
change
the
human
problems
in
the
world
grow
more
acute
hour
by
hour
yet
new
gains
in
science
and
technology
continually
extend
the
promise
of
a
better
life
people
yearn
to
be
free
to
govern
themselves
yet
a
third
of
the
people
of
the
world
have
no
freedom
do
not
govern
themselves
the
world
recognizes
the
catastrophic
nature
of
nuclear
war
yet
it
sees
the
wondrous
potential
of
nuclear
peace
during
the
period
the
united
states
has
forged
ahead
under
a
constructive
foreign
policy
the
continuing
goal
is
peace
liberty
and
wellbeingfor
others
as
well
as
ourselves
the
aspirations
of
all
peoples
are
onepeace
with
justice
in
freedom
peace
can
only
be
attained
collectively
as
peoples
everywhere
unite
in
their
determination
that
liberty
and
wellbeing
come
to
all
mankind
yet
while
we
have
worked
to
advance
national
aspirations
for
freedom
a
divisive
force
has
been
at
work
to
divert
that
aspiration
into
dangerous
channels
the
communist
movement
throughout
the
world
exploits
the
natural
striving
of
all
to
be
free
and
attempts
to
subjugate
men
rather
than
free
them
these
activities
have
caused
and
are
continuing
to
cause
grave
troubles
in
the
world
here
at
home
these
have
been
times
for
careful
adjustment
of
our
economy
from
the
artificial
impetus
of
a
hot
war
to
constructive
growth
in
a
precarious
peace
while
building
a
new
economic
vitality
without
inflation
we
have
also
increased
public
expenditures
to
keep
abreast
of
the
needs
of
a
growing
population
and
its
attendant
new
problems
as
well
as
our
added
international
responsibilities
we
have
worked
toward
these
ends
in
a
context
of
shared
responsibilityconscious
of
the
need
for
maximum
scope
to
private
effort
and
for
state
and
local
as
well
as
federal
governmental
action
success
in
designing
and
executing
national
purposes
domestically
and
abroad
can
only
come
from
a
steadfast
resolution
that
integrity
in
the
operation
of
government
and
in
our
relations
with
each
other
be
fully
maintained
only
in
this
way
could
our
spiritual
goals
be
fully
advanced
foreign
policy
on
january
when
i
took
office
the
united
states
was
at
war
since
the
signing
of
the
korean
armistice
in
americans
have
lived
in
peace
in
highly
troubled
times
during
the

crisis
the
united

strongly
supported
united

actionresulting
in
the
ending
of
the
hostilities
in
egypt
again
in
peace
was
preserved
in
the
middle
east
despite
new
discord
our
government
responded
to
the
request
of
the
friendly
lebanese
government
for
military
help
and
promptly
withdrew
american
forces
as
soon
as
the
situation
was
stabilized
in
our
support
of
the
republic
of
china
during
the
allout
bombardment
of
quemoy
restrained
the
communist
chinese
from
attempting
to
invade
the
offshore
islands
although
unhappily
communist
penetration
of
cuba
is
real
and
poses
a
serious
threat
communist
dominated
regimes
have
been
deposed
in
guatemala
and
iran
the
occupation
of
austria
has
ended
and
the
trieste
question
has
been
settled
despite
constant
threats
to
its
integrity
west
berlin
has
remained
free
important
advances
have
been
made
in
building
mutual
security
arrangementswhich
lie
at
the
heart
of
our
hopes
for
future
peace
and
security
in
the
world
the
southeast
asia
treaty
organization
has
been
established
the
nato
alliance
has
been
militarily
strengthened
the
organization
of
american
states
has
been
further
developed
as
an
instrument
of
interamerican
cooperation
the
anzus
treaty
has
strengthened
ties
with
australia
and
new
zealand
and
a
mutual
security
treaty
with
japan
has
been
signed
in
addition
the
cento
pact
has
been
concluded
and
while
we
are
not
officially
a
member
of
this
alliance
we
have
participated
closely
in
its
deliberations
the
atoms
for
peace
proposal
to
the
united
nations
led
to
the
creation
of
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
our
policy
has
been
to
push
for
enforceable
programs
of
inspection
against
surprise
attack
suspension
of
nuclear
testing
arms
reduction
and
peaceful
use
of
outer
space
the
united
nations
has
been
vigorously
supported
in
all
of
its
actions
including
the
condemnations
of
the
wholesale
murder
of
the
people
of
tibet
by
the
chinese
communists
and
the
brutal
soviet
repression
of
the
people
of
hungary
as
well
as
the
more
recent
un
actions
in
the
congo
the
united
states
took
the
initiative
in
negotiating
the
significant
treaty
to
guarantee
the
peaceful
use
of
vast
antarctica
the
united
states
information
agency
has
been
transformed
into
a
greatly
improved
medium
for
explaining
our
policies
and
actions
to
audiences
overseas
answering
the
lies
of
communist
propaganda
and
projecting
a
clearer
image
of
american
life
and
culture
cultural
technological
and
educational
exchanges
with
the
soviet
union
have
been
encouraged
and
a
comprehensive
agreement
was
made
which
authorized
among
other
things
the
distribution
of
our
russian
language
magazine
amerika
and
the
highly
successful
american
exhibition
in
moscow
this
country
has
continued
to
withhold
recognition
of
communist
china
and
to
oppose
vigorously
the
admission
of
this
belligerent
and
unrepentant
nation
into
the
united
nations
red
china
has
yet
to
demonstrate
that
it
deserves
to
be
considered
a
peaceloving
nation
with
communist
imperialism
held
in
check
constructive
actions
were
undertaken
to
strengthen
the
economies
of
free
world
nations
the
united

government
has
given
sturdy
support
to
the
economic
and

of

and
i
travelled
extensively
through
the
world
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
the
cause
of
peace
freedom
and
international
understanding
so
rewarding
were
these
visits
that
their
very
success
became
a
significant
factor
in
causing
the

wreck
the

conference
of
these
vital
programs
must
go
on
new
tactics
will
have
to
be
developed
of

to
meet
new
situations
but
the
underlying
principles
should
be
constant
our
great
moral
and
material
commitments
to
collective
security
deterrence
of
force
international
law
negotiations
that
lead
to
selfenforcing
agreements
and
the
economic
interdependence
of

should
remain
the
cornerstone
of
a
foreign
policy
that
will
ultimately
bring
permanent
peace
with
justice
in
freedom
to
all
mankind
the
continuing
need
of
all
free
nations
today
is
for
each
to
recognize
clearly
the
essentiality
of
an
unbreakable
bond
among
themselves
based
upon
a
complete
dedication
to
the
principles
of
collective

effective
cooperation
and

national

for
the
first
time
in

history
we
have
consistently

in
peacetime
military
forces
of
a
magnitude
sufficient
to
deter
and
if
need
be
to
destroy
predatory
forces
in
the
world
tremendous
advances
in
strategic
weapons
systems
have
been
made
in
the
past
eight
years
not
until
were

on
longrange

programs
even
as
much
as
a
million
dollars
a

today
we
spend
ten
times
as
much
each

on
these
programs
as
was
spent
in
all
of
no
guided
ballistic

operational
at
the
beginning
of
today
many
types
give
our

unprecedented

the
explosive

of
our

systems
for
all

is
almost
inconceivable
today
the

has
operational
atlas

which

the

eight

we

today
nuclear

have
been

of
these

including

guarding
the

our

a

the

the

has
been
shortened
in

to
meet
the

these
major
reorganizations
have
provided
a
more

for

of

gradual

us
military
assistance
goes
almost
exclusively
to
friendly
nations
on
the
rim
of
the
communist
world
this
american
contribution
to
nations
who
have
the
will
to
defend
their
freedom
but
insufficient
means
should
be
vigorously
continued
combined
with
our
allies
the
free
world
now
has
a
far
stronger
shield
than
we
could
provide
alone
since
our
defense
policy
has
been
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
international
situation
would
require
heavy
defense
expenditures
for
an
indefinite
period
to
come
probably
for
years
in
this
protracted
struggle
good
management
dictates
that
we
resist
overspending
as
resolutely
as
we
oppose
underspending
every
dollar
uselessly
spent
on
military
mechanisms
decreases
our
total
strength
and
therefore
our
security
we
must
not
return
to
the
crashprogram
psychology
of
the
past
when
each
new
feint
by
the
communists
was
responded
to
in
panic
the
bomber
gap
of
several
years
ago
was
always
a
fiction
and
the
missile
gap
shows
every
sign
of
being
the
same
the
nation
can
ill
afford
to
abandon
a
national
policy
which
provides
for
a
fully
adequate
and
steady
level
of
effort
designed
for
the
long
pull
a
fast
adjustment
to
new
scientific
and
technological
advances
a
balanced
force
of
such
strength
as
to
deter
general
war
to
effectively
meet
local
situations
and
to
retaliate
to
attack
and
destroy
the
attacker
and
a
strengthened
system
of
free
world
collective
security
the
economy
the
expanding
american
economy
passed
the
halftrillion
dollar
mark
in
gross
national
product
early
in
the
nations
output
of
goods
and
services
is
now
nearly
percent
higher
than
in
in
the
average
american
family
had
an
income
of
percent
higher
in
dollars
of
constant
buying
power
than
in
and
the
real
wages
of
american
factory
workers
have
risen
percent
during
the
past
eight
years
these
facts
reflect
the
rising
standard
of
individual
and
family
wellbeing
enjoyed
by
americans
our
nation
benefits
also
from
a
remarkable
improvement
in
general
industrial
peace
through
strengthened
processes
of
free
collective
bargaining
time
lost
since
because
of
strikes
has
been
half
that
lost
in
the
eight
years
prior
to
that
date
legislation
now
requires
that
union
members
have
the
opportunity
for
full
participation
in
the
affairs
of
their
unions
the
administration
supported
the
landrumgriffin
act
which
i
believe
is
greatly
helpful
to
the
vast
bulk
of
american
labor
and
its
leaders
and
also
is
a
major
step
in
getting
racketeers
and
gangsters
out
of
labormanagement
affairs
the
economic
security
of
working
men
and
women
has
been
strengthened
by
an
extension
of
unemployment
insurance
coverage
to
million
exservicemen
million
federal
employees
and
million
employees
of
small

and
by
a
strengthening
of
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
states
have
been
encouraged
to
improve
their
unemployment
compensation
benefits
so
that
today
average
weekly
benefits
are
percent
higher
than
in
determined
efforts
have
improved
workers
safety
standards
enforceable
safety
standards
have
been
established
for
longshoremen
and
ship
repair
workers
federal
safety
councils
have
been
increased
from
to
over
safety
awards
have
been
initiated
and
a
national
construction
safety
program
has
been
developed
a
major
factor
in
strengthening
our
competitive
enterprise
system
and
promoting
economic
growth
has
been
the
vigorous
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws
over
the
last
eight
years
and
a
continuing
effort
to
reduce
artificial
restraints
on
competition
and
trade
and
enhance
our
economic
liberties
this
purpose
was
also
significantly
advanced
in
when
as
one
of
the
first
acts
of
this
administration
restrictive
wage
and
price
controls
were
ended
an
additional
measure
to
strengthen
the
american
system
of
competitive
enterprise
was
the
creation
of
the
small
business
administration
in
to
assist
existing
small
businesses
and
encourage
new
ones
this
agency
has
approved
over
billion
in
loans
initiated
a
new
program
to
provide
longterm
capital
for
small
businesses
aided
in
setting
aside
billion
in
government
contracts
for
award
to
small
business
concerns
and
brought
to
the
attention
of
individual
businessmen
through
programs
of
information
and
education
new
developments
in
management
and

techniques
since
important

have
been
made

included
also
a
vigorous
program
for
expanding
our
trade
with
other
nations
a
year
renewal
of
the
reciprocal
trade
agreements
act
was
passed
in
and
a
continuing
and
rewarding
effort
has
been
made
to
persuade
other
countries
to
remove
restrictions
against
our
exports
a
new
export
expansion
program
was
launched
in
inaugurating
improvement
of
export
credit
insurance
and
broadening
research
and
information
programs
to
awaken
americans
to
business
opportunities
overseas
these
actions
and
generally
prosperous
conditions
abroad
have
helped
push
americas
export
trade
to
a
level
of
billion
in
although
intermittent
declines
in
economic
activity
persist
as
a
problem
in
our
enterprise
system
recent
downturns
have
been
moderate
and
of
short
duration
there
is
however
little
room
for
complacency
currently
our
economy
is
operating
at
high
levels
but
unemployment
rates
are
higher
than
any
of
us
would
like
and
chronic
pockets
of
high
unemployment
persist
clearly
continued
sound
and
broadly
shared
economic
growth
remains
a
major
national
objective
toward
which
we
must
strive
through
joint
private
and
public
efforts
if
government
continues
to
work
to
assure
every
american
the
fullest
opportunity
to
develop
and
utilize
his
ability
and

it
will
be
performing
one
of

in

the

dollar
was
worth
only
cents
in
terms
of
the

it
would
buy
compared
to
today
the
inflationary
spiral
which
had
raised
the
cost
of

by
percent
between

has
all
but
ceased
and
the
value
of

virtually
stabilized
in
we
had
the
largest
tax
cut
in
history
amounting
to
billion
annually
of
which
over
percent
went
to
individuals
mostly
in
the
small

brackets
this
administration
has
directed
constant
efforts
toward
fiscal
responsibility
balanced
budgets
have
been
sought
when
the

was
advancing
and
a
rigorous
evaluation
of
spending
programs
has
been
maintained
at
all
times
resort
to
deficit
financing
in
prosperous
times
could
easily
erode
international
confidence
in

and
contribute
to

at

in
this
belief
i
shall
submit
a
balanced
budget
for

to
the
congress
next
week
there
has
been
a
firm
policy
of
reducing
government
competition
with
private
enterprise
this
has
resulted
in
the
discontinuance
of
some
commercial
industrial
installations
and
in
addition
the
curtailment
of
approximately
industrial
installations
operated
directly
by
government

also
an
aggressive

disposal
program
has
been
carried
on
to
identify

dispose

this
has
resulted
in
the
addition
of
a
substantial
number
of
valuable

to
local

rolls
and
a
significant
monetary
return
to

earnest
and
persistent
attempts
have
been
made
to
strengthen
the
position
of

thereby
to

yet
in
certain
aspects
our

situation
is
increasingly
grave
for

now
total
billion

if
we

we

still
have
all
we

eat
all
we
could
sell

all
we
could
give
away
and
still
have
a
substantial
carryover
extraordinary
costs
are
involved
just
in
management
and
disposal
of
this
burdensome
surplus
obviously
important
adjustments
must
still
come
congress
must
enact
additional
legislation
to
permit
wheat
and
other
farm
commodities
to
move
into
regular
marketing
channels
in
an
orderly
manner
and
at
the

time
afford
the

protection
to
the

only
then
will
agriculture

the
national
defense
education
act
of
is
already
a
milestone
in
the
history
of
american
education
it
provides
broad
opportunities
for
the
intellectual
development
of
all
children
by
strengthening
courses
of
study
in
science
mathematics
and
foreign
languages
by
developing
new
graduate
programs
to
train
additional
teachers
and
by
providing
loans
for
young
people
who
need
financial
help
to
go
to

the
administration
proposed
on
numerous
occasions
a
broad
new
fiveyear
program
of
federal
aid
to
help
overcome
the
classroom
shortage
in
public
elementary
and
secondary

recommendations
were
also
made
to
give
assistance
to
colleges
and
universities
for
the
construction
of
academic

greatly
expanded

programs
designed
to
advance
the

indian
in

last
fall
for
example
percent
of
the
indian
children
between
the
ages
of

were
enrolled
in

this
is
a
rise
of
percent
since
in
the
field
of
science
and
technology
startling
strides
have
been
made
by
the
new
national
aeronautics

administration
in
little
more
than
two
years
nasa
has
successfully
launched
meteorological
satellites
such
as
tiros
i
and
tiros
ii
that
promise
to
revolutionize
methods
of
weather
forecasting
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
satellites
for
global
communications
by
the
successful
launching
of
echo
i
produced
an
enormous
amount
of
valuable
scientific

such
as
the
discovery
of

successfully
launched
deepspace
probes
that
maintained
communication
over
the
greatest
range
man
has
ever
tracked
and
made
real
progress
toward
the
goal
of
manned

flights
these
achievements
unquestionably
make
us
preeminent
today
in

exploration
for
the
betterment
of
mankind
i
believe
the
present
organizational
arrangements
in
this
area
with
the
revisions
proposed
last
year
are
completely
adequate
for
the
tasks
ahead
americans
can
look
forward
to
new
achievements
in
space
exploration
the
near
future
will
hold
such
wonders
as
the
orbital
flight
of
an
astronaut
the
landing
of

on
the

the
launching
of
the
powerful

with
the

expect
to
maintain

this
pioneering
work
in

has
made
legislative
recommendations
to
liberalize

while
still
safeguarding
the
national
interest
it
is
imperative
that
our
immigration

in
the
finest
american
tradition
of
providing
a
haven
for
oppressed

conclusion
in
concluding
my
final
message
to
the
congress
it
is
fitting
to
look
back
to
my
firstto
the
aims
and
ideals
i
set
forth
on
february
to
use
americas
influence
in
world
affairs
to
advance
the
cause
of
peace
and
justice
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
executive
branch
with
integrity
and
efficiency
to
encourage
creative
initiative
in
our
economy
and
to
work
toward
the
attainment
of
the
wellbeing
and
equality
of
opportunity
of
all
citizens
equally
we
have
honored
our
commitment
to
pursue
and
attain
specific
objectives
among
them
as
stated
eight
years
ago
strengthening
of
the
mutual
security
program
development
of
world
trade
and
commerce
ending
of
hostilities
in
korea
creation
of
a
powerful
deterrent
force
practicing
fiscal
responsibility
checking
the
menace
of
inflation
reducing
the
tax
burden
providing
an
effective
internal
security
program
developing
and
conserving
our
natural
resources
reducing
governmental
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
farmer
strengthening
and
improving
services
by
the
department
of
labor
and
the
vigilant
guarding
of
civil
and
social
fights
i
do
not
close
this
message
implying
that
all
is
wellthat
all
problems
are
solved
for
progress
implies
both
new
and
continuing
problems
and
unlike
presidential
administrations
problems
rarely
have
terminal
dates
abroad
there
is
the
continuing
communist
threat
to
the
freedom
of
berlin
an
explosive
situation
in
laos
the
problems
caused
by
communist
penetration
of
cuba
as
well
as
the
many
problems
connected
with
the
development
of
the
new
nations
in
africa
these
areas
in
particular
call
for
delicate
handling
and
constant
review
at
home
several
conspicuous
problems
remain
promoting
higher
levels
of
employment
with
special
emphasis
on
areas
in
which
heavy
unemployment
has
persisted
continuing
to
provide
for
steady
economic
growth
and
preserving
a
sound
currency
bringing
our
balance
of
payments
into
more
reasonable
equilibrium
and
continuing
a
high
level
of
confidence
in
our
national
and
international
systems
eliminating
heavily
excessive
surpluses
of
a
few
farm
commodities
and
overcoming
deficiencies
in
our
health
and
educational
programs
our
goal
always
has
been
to
add
to
the
spiritual
moral
and
material
strength
of
our
nation
i
believe
we
have
done
this
but
it
is
a
process
that
must
never
end
let
us
pray
that
leaders
of
both
the
near
and
distant
future
will
be
able
to
keep
the
nation
strong
and
at
peace
that
they
will
advance
the
wellbeing
of
all
our
people
that
they
will
lead
us
on
to
still
higher
moral
standards
and
that
in
achieving
these
goals
they
will
maintain
a
reasonable
balance
between
private
and
governmental
responsibility
